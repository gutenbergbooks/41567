<p><span class="bold">LETTER<a name="ar1" id="ar1"></a></span> (through Fr. <i>lettre</i> from Lat. <i>littera</i> or <i>litera</i>, letter
of the alphabet; the origin of the Latin word is obscure; it has
probably no connexion with the root of <i>linere</i>, to smear, <i>i.e.</i> with
wax, for an inscription with a stilus), a character or symbol
expressing any one of the elementary sounds into which a spoken
word may be analysed, one of the members of an alphabet. As
applied to things written, the word follows mainly the meanings
of the Latin plural <i>litterae</i>, the most common meaning attaching
to the word being that of a written communication from one
person to another, an epistle (<i>q.v.</i>). For the means adopted to
secure the transmission of letters see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Post and Postal Service</a></span>.
The word is also, particularly in the plural, applied to many
legal and formal written documents, as in letters patent, letters
rogatory and dismissory, &amp;c. The Latin use of the plural is also
followed in the employment of &ldquo;letters&rdquo; in the sense of literature
(<i>q.v.</i>) or learning.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LETTERKENNY,<a name="ar2" id="ar2"></a></span> a market town of Co. Donegal, Ireland,
23 m. W. by S. of Londonderry by the Londonderry and Lough
Swilly and Letterkenny railway. Pop. (1901) 2370. It has a
harbour at Port Ballyrane, 1 m. distant on Lough Swilly. In
the market square a considerable trade in grain, flax and provisions

<p><span class="bold">LETTERS PATENT.<a name="ar4" id="ar4"></a></span> It is a rule alike of common law and
sound policy that grants of freehold interests, franchises, liberties,
&amp;c., by the sovereign to a subject should be made only after due
consideration, and in a form readily accessible to the public.
These ends are attained in England through the agency of
that piece of constitutional machinery known as &ldquo;letters
patent.&rdquo; It is here proposed to consider only the characteristics
of letters patent generally. The law relating to
letters patent for inventions is dealt with under the heading
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Patents</a></span>.</p>

<p>Letters patent (<i>litterae patentes</i>) are letters addressed by the
sovereign &ldquo;to all to whom these presents shall come,&rdquo; reciting
the grant of some dignity, office, monopoly, franchise or other
privilege to the patentee. They are not sealed up, but are left
open (hence the term &ldquo;patent&rdquo;), and are recorded in the Patent
Rolls in the Record Office, or in the case of very recent grants,
in the Chancery Enrolment Office, so that all subjects of the
realm may read and be bound by their contents. In this respect
they differ from certain other letters of the sovereign directed
to particular persons and for particular purposes, which, not
being proper for public inspection, are closed up and sealed on
the outside, and are thereupon called <i>writs close</i> (<i>litterae clausae</i>)
and are recorded in the Close Rolls. Letters patent are used to
put into commission various powers inherent in the crown&mdash;legislative
powers, as when the sovereign entrusts to others the
duty of opening parliament or assenting to bills; judicial powers,
<i>e.g.</i> of gaol delivery; executive powers, as when the duties of
Treasurer and Lord High Admiral are assigned to commissioners
of the Treasury and Admiralty (Anson, <i>Const.</i> ii. 47). Letters
patent are also used to incorporate bodies by charter&mdash;in the
British colonies, this mode of legislation is frequently applied
to joint stock companies (cf. Rev. Stats. Ontario, c. 191, s. 9)&mdash;to
grant a <i>congé d&rsquo;élire</i> to a dean and chapter to elect a bishop,
or licence to convocation to amend canons; to grant pardon,
and to confer certain offices and dignities. Among grants of
offices, &amp;c., made by letters patent the following may be enumerated:
offices in the Heralds&rsquo; College; the dignities of a peer,
baronet and knight bachelor; the appointments of lord-lieutenant,
custos rotulorum of counties, judge of the High Court and
Indian and Colonial judgeships, king&rsquo;s counsel, crown livings;
the offices of attorney- and solicitor-general, commander-in-chief,
master of the horse, keeper of the privy seal, postmaster-general,
king&rsquo;s printer; grants of separate courts of quarter-sessions.
The fees payable in respect of the grant of various
forms of letters patent are fixed by orders of the lord chancellor,
dated 20th of June 1871, 18th of July 1871 and 11th of Aug.
1881. (These orders are set out at length in the <i>Statutory Rules
and Orders Revised</i> (ed. 1904), vol. ii. <i>tit.</i> &ldquo;Clerk of the Crown in
Chancery,&rdquo; pp. i. et seq.) Formerly each colonial governor was
appointed and commissioned by letters patent under the great
seal of the United Kingdom. But since 1875, the practice has
been to create the office of governor in each colony by letters
patent, and then to make each appointment to the office by
commission under the Royal Sign Manual and to give to the
governor so appointed instructions in a uniform shape under
the Royal Sign Manual. The letters patent, commission and
instructions, are commonly described as the Governor&rsquo;s Commission
(see Jenkyns, <i>British Rule and Jurisdiction beyond the
Seas</i>, p. 100; the forms now in use are printed in Appx. iv.
Also the <i>Statutory Rules and Codes Revised</i>, ed. 1904, under the
title of the colony to which they relate). The Colonial Letters
Patent Act 1863 provides that letters patent shall not take
effect in the colonies or possessions beyond the seas until their
publication there by proclamation or otherwise (s. 2), and shall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page502" id="page502"></a>502</span>
be void unless so published within nine months in the case of
colonies east of Bengal or west of Cape Horn, and within six
months in any other case. Colonial officers and judges holding
offices by patent for life or for a term certain, are removable
by a special procedure&mdash;&ldquo;amotion&rdquo;&mdash;by the Governor and
Council, subject to a right of appeal to the king in Council
(Leave of Absence Act, formerly cited as &ldquo;Burke&rsquo;s Act&rdquo; 1782;
see <i>Montagu</i> v. <i>Governor of Van Diemen&rsquo;s Land</i>, 1849, 6 Moo.
P.C. 491; <i>Willis</i> v. <i>Gipps</i>, 1846, 6 St. Trials [N.S., 311]). The
law of conquered or ceded colonies may be altered by the crown
by letters patent under the Great Seal as well as by Proclamation
or Order in Council (<i>Jephson</i> v. <i>Riera</i>, 1835, 3 Knapp, 130;
3 St. Trials [N.S.] 591).</p>

<p><i>Procedure.</i>&mdash;Formerly letters patent were always granted
under the Great Seal. But now, under the Crown Office Act 1877,
and the Orders in Council made under it, many letters patent
are sealed with the wafer great seal. Letters patent for inventions
are issued under the seal of the Patent Office. The procedure
by which letters patent are obtained is as follows: A
warrant for the issue of letters patent is drawn up; and is signed
by the lord chancellor; this is submitted to the law officers of
the crown, who countersign it; finally, the warrant thus signed
and countersigned is submitted to His Majesty, who affixes his
signature. The warrant is then sent to the Crown Office and is
filed, after it has been acted upon by the issue of letters patent
under the great or under the wafer seal as the case may be. The
letters patent are then delivered into the custody of those in
whose favour they are granted.</p>

<p><i>Construction.</i>&mdash;The construction of letters patent differs from
that of other grants in certain particulars: (i.) Letters patent,
contrary to the ordinary rule, are construed in a sense favourable
to the grantor (viz. the crown) rather than to the grantee;
although this rule is said not to apply so strictly where the grant
is made for consideration, or where it purports to be made <i>ex
certâ scientiâ et mero motu</i>. (ii.) When it appears from the face
of the grant that the sovereign has been mistaken or deceived,
either in matter of fact or in matter of law, as, <i>e.g.</i> by false
suggestion on the part of the patentee, or by misrecital of former
grants, or if the grant is contrary to law or uncertain, the letters
patent are absolutely void, and may still, it would seem, be
cancelled (except as regards letters patent for inventions, which
are revoked by a special procedure, regulated by § 26 of the
Patents Act 1883), by the procedure known as scire facias, an
action brought against the patentee in the name of the crown
with the fiat of the attorney-general.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LETTRES DE CACHET.<a name="ar5" id="ar5"></a></span> Considered solely as French documents,
<i>lettres de cachet</i> may be defined as letters signed by the
king of France, countersigned by one of his ministers, and closed
with the royal seal (<i>cachet</i>). They contained an order&mdash;in
principle, any order whatsoever&mdash;emanating directly from the
king, and executory by himself. In the case of organized bodies
<i>lettres de cachet</i> were issued for the purpose of enjoining members
to assemble or to accomplish some definite act; the provincial
estates were convoked in this manner, and it was by <i>a lettre de
cachet</i> (called <i>lettre de jussion</i>) that the king ordered a parlement
to register a law in the teeth of its own remonstrances. The
best-known <i>lettres de cachet</i>, however, were those which may be
called penal, by which the king sentenced a subject without trial
and without an opportunity of defence to imprisonment in a
state prison or an ordinary gaol, confinement in a convent or a
hospital, transportation to the colonies, or relegation to a given
place within the realm.</p>

<p>The power which the king exercised on these various occasions
was a royal privilege recognized by old French law, and can be
traced to a maxim which furnished a text of the <i>Digest</i> of Justinian:
&ldquo;Rex solutus est a legibus.&rdquo; This signified particularly
that when the king intervened directly in the administration
proper, or in the administration of justice, by a special act of
his will, he could decide without heeding the laws, and even in
a sense contrary to the laws. This was an early conception, and
in early times the order in question was simply verbal; thus
some letters patent of Henry III. of France in 1576 (Isambert,
<i>Anciennes lois françaises</i>, xiv. 278) state that François de Montmorency
was &ldquo;prisoner in our castle of the Bastille in Paris by
verbal command&rdquo; of the late king Charles IX. But in the 14th
century the principle was introduced that the order should be
written, and hence arose the <i>lettre de cachet</i>. The <i>lettre de cachet</i>
belonged to the class of <i>lettres closes</i>, as opposed to <i>lettres patentes</i>,
which contained the expression of the legal and permanent will
of the king, and had to be furnished with the seal of state affixed
by the chancellor. The <i>lettres de cachet</i>, on the contrary, were
signed simply by a secretary of state (formerly known as <i>secrétaire
des commandements</i>) for the king; they bore merely the
imprint of the king&rsquo;s privy seal, from which circumstance they
were often called, in the 14th and 15th centuries, <i>lettres de petit
signet</i> or <i>lettres de petit cachet</i>, and were entirely exempt from the
control of the chancellor.</p>

<p>While serving the government as a silent weapon against
political adversaries or dangerous writers and as a means of
punishing culprits of high birth without the scandal of a suit at
law, the <i>lettres de cachet</i> had many other uses. They were
employed by the police in dealing with prostitutes, and on their
authority lunatics were shut up in hospitals and sometimes in
prisons. They were also often used by heads of families as a
means of correction, <i>e.g.</i> for protecting the family honour from
the disorderly or criminal conduct of sons; wives, too, took
advantage of them to curb the profligacy of husbands and
vice versa. They were issued by the intermediary on the advice
of the intendants in the provinces and of the lieutenant of police
in Paris. In reality, the secretary of state issued them in a
completely arbitrary fashion, and in most cases the king was
unaware of their issue. In the 18th century it is certain that the
letters were often issued blank, <i>i.e.</i> without containing the name
of the person against whom they were directed; the recipient,
or mandatary, filled in the name in order to make the letter
effective.</p>

<p>Protests against the <i>lettres de cachet</i> were made continually
by the parlement of Paris and by the provincial parlements,
and often also by the States-General. In 1648 the sovereign
courts of Paris procured their momentary suppression in a kind
of charter of liberties which they imposed upon the crown,
but which was ephemeral. It was not until the reign of
Louis XVI. that a reaction against this abuse became clearly
perceptible. At the beginning of that reign Malesherbes during
his short ministry endeavoured to infuse some measure of justice
into the system, and in March 1784 the baron de Breteuil, a
minister of the king&rsquo;s household, addressed a circular to the
intendants and the lieutenant of police with a view to preventing
the crying abuses connected with the issue of <i>lettres de cachet</i>.
In Paris, in 1779, the <i>Cour des Aides</i> demanded their suppression,
and in March 1788 the parlement of Paris made some exceedingly
energetic remonstrances, which are important for the light they
throw upon old French public law. The crown, however, did
not decide to lay aside this weapon, and in a declaration to the
States-General in the royal session of the 23rd of June 1789
(art. 15) it did not renounce it absolutely. <i>Lettres de cachet</i>
were abolished by the Constituent Assembly, but Napoleon re-established
their equivalent by a political measure in the decree
of the 9th of March 1801 on the state prisons. This was one of
the acts brought up against him by the <i>sénatus-consulte</i> of the
3rd of April 1814, which pronounced his fall &ldquo;considering that
he has violated the constitutional laws by the decrees on the
state prisons.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">LETTUCE,<a name="ar6" id="ar6"></a></span> known botanically as <i>Lactuca sativa</i> (nat. ord.
Compositae), a hardy annual, highly esteemed as a salad plant.
The London market-gardeners make preparation for the first
main crop of Cos lettuces in the open ground early in August,
a frame being set on a shallow hotbed, and, the stimulus of heat
not being required, this is allowed to subside till the first week in
October, when the soil, consisting of leaf-mould mixed with a
little sand, is put on 6 or 7 in. thick, so that the surface is within
4½ in. of the sashes. The best time for sowing is found to be
about the 11th of October, one of the best varieties being Lobjoits
Green Cos. When the seeds begin to germinate the sashes are
drawn quite off in favourable weather during the day, and put
on, but tilted, at night in wet weather. Very little watering is
required, and the aim should be to keep the plants gently moving
till the days begin to lengthen. In January a more active
growth is encouraged, and in mild winters a considerable extent
of the planting out is done, but in private gardens the preferable
time would be February. The ground should be light and rich,
and well manured below, and the plants put out at 1 ft. apart
each way with the dibble. Frequent stirring of the ground
with the hoe greatly encourages the growth of the plants. A
second sowing should be made about the 5th of November, and
a third in frames about the end of January or beginning of
February. In March a sowing may be made in some warm
situation out of doors; successional sowings may be made in the
open border about every third or fourth week till August,
about the middle of which month a crop of Brown Cos, Hardy
Hammersmith or Hardy White Cos should be sown, the latter
being the most reliable in a severe winter. These plants may be
put out early in October on the sides of ridges facing the south
or at the front of a south wall, beyond the reach of drops from
the copings, being planted 6 or 8 in. apart. Young lettuce
plants should be thinned out in the seed-beds before they crowd
or draw each other, and transplanted as soon as possible after
two or three leaves are formed. Some cultivators prefer that
the summer crops should not be transplanted, but sown where
they are to stand, the plants being merely thinned out; but
transplanting checks the running to seed, and makes the most of
the ground.</p>

<p>For a winter supply by gentle forcing, the Hardy Hammersmith
and Brown Dutch Cabbage lettuces, and the Brown Cos
and Green Paris Cos lettuces, should be sown about the middle
of August and in the beginning of September, in rich light soil,
the plants being pricked out 3 in. apart in a prepared bed, as
soon as the first two leaves are fully formed. About the middle
of October the plants should be taken up carefully with balls
attached to the roots, and should be placed in a mild hotbed of
well-prepared dung (about 55°) covered about 1 ft. deep with a
compost of sandy peat, leaf-mould and a little well-decomposed
manure. The Cos and Brown Dutch varieties should be planted
about 9 in. apart. Give plenty of air when the weather permits,
and protect from frost. For winter work Stanstead Park
Cabbage Lettuce is greatly favoured now by London market-gardeners,
as it stands the winter well. Lee&rsquo;s Immense is another
good variety, while All the Year Round may be sown for almost
any season, but is better perhaps for summer crops.</p>

<p>There are two races of the lettuce, the Cos lettuce, with erect
oblong heads, and the Cabbage lettuce, with round or spreading
heads,&mdash;the former generally crisp, the latter soft and flabby in
texture. Some of the best lettuces for general purposes of the
two classes are the following:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Cos:</i> White Paris Cos, best for summer; Green Paris Cos,
hardier than the white; Brown Cos, Lobjoits Green Cos, one of
the hardiest and best for winter; Hardy White Cos.</p>

<p><i>Cabbage:</i> Hammersmith Hardy Green; Stanstead Park,
very hardy, good for winter; Tom Thumb; Brown Dutch;
Neapolitan, best for summer; All the Year Round; Golden
Ball, good for forcing in private establishments.</p>

<p><i>Lactuca virosa</i>, the strong-scented lettuce, contains an alkaloid
which has the power of dilating the pupil and may possibly
be identical with hyoscyamine, though this point is as yet not
determined. No variety of lettuce is now used for any medicinal
purpose, though there is probably some slight foundation for
the belief that the lettuce has faint narcotic properties.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEUCIPPUS,<a name="ar8" id="ar8"></a></span> Greek philosopher, born at Miletus (or Elea),
founder of the Atomistic theory, contemporary of Zeno,
Empedocles and Anaxagoras. His fame was so completely overshadowed
by that of Democritus, who subsequently developed
the theory into a system, that his very existence was denied by
Epicurus (Diog. Laërt. x. 7), followed in modern times by
E. Rohde. Epicurus, however, distinguishes Leucippus from
Democritus, and Aristotle and Theophrastus expressly credit
him with the invention of Atomism. There seems, therefore, no
reason to doubt his existence, although nothing is known of his
life, and even his birthplace is uncertain. Between Leucippus
and Democritus there is an interval of at least forty years;
accordingly, while the beginnings of Atomism are closely connected
with the doctrines of the Eleatics, the system as developed
by Democritus is conditioned by the sophistical views of his
time, especially those of Protagoras. While Leucippus&rsquo;s notion
of Being agreed generally with that of the Eleatics, he postulated
its plurality (atoms) and motion, and the reality of not-Being
(the void) in which his atoms moved.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEUCITE,<a name="ar9" id="ar9"></a></span> a rock-forming mineral composed of potassium and
aluminium metasilicate KAl(SiO<span class="su">3</span>)<span class="su">2</span>. Crystals have the form
of cubic icositetrahedra {211}, but, as first observed by Sir David
Brewster in 1821, they are not optically isotropic, and are therefore
pseudo-cubic. Goniometric measurements made by G. vom
Rath in 1873 led him to refer the crystals to the tetragonal
system, the faces o being distinct from those lettered i in the
adjoining figure. Optical investigations have since proved
the crystals to be still more complex
in character, and to consist of several
orthorhombic or monoclinic individuals,
which are optically biaxial
and repeatedly twinned, giving rise
to twin-lamellae and to striations on
the faces. When the crystals are
raised to a temperature of about
500° C. they become optically isotropic,
the twin-lamellae and striations
disappearing, reappearing,
however, when the crystals are again
cooled. This pseudo-cubic character of leucite is exactly the
same as that of the mineral boracite (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p>The crystals are white (hence the name suggested by A. G.
Werner in 1791, from <span class="grk" title="leukos">&#955;&#949;&#965;&#954;&#972;&#962;</span>) or ash-grey in colour, and are
usually dull and opaque, but sometimes transparent and glassy;
they are brittle and break with a conchoidal fracture. The
hardness is 5.5, and the specific gravity 2.5. Enclosures of other
minerals, arranged in concentric zones, are frequently present in
the crystals. On account of the colour and form of the crystals
the mineral was early known as &ldquo;white garnet.&rdquo; French
authors employ R. J. Haüy&rsquo;s name &ldquo;amphigène.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="author">(L. J. S.)</div>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Leucite Rocks.</i>&mdash;Although rocks containing leucite are numerically
scarce, many countries such as England being entirely without them,
yet they are of wide distribution, occurring in every quarter of the
globe. Taken collectively, they exhibit a considerable variety of
types and are of great interest petrographically. For the presence
of this mineral it is necessary that the silica percentage of the rock
should not be high, for leucite never occurs in presence of free quartz.
It is most common in lavas of recent and Tertiary age, which have a
fair amount of potash, or at any rate have potash equal to or greater
than soda; if soda preponderates nepheline occurs rather than
leucite. In pre-Tertiary rocks leucite is uncommon, since it readily
decomposes and changes to zeolites, analcite and other secondary
minerals. Leucite also is rare in plutonic rocks and dike rocks, but
leucite-syenite and leucite-tinguaite bear witness to the possibility
that it may occur in this manner. The rounded shape of its crystals,
their white or grey colour, and rough cleavage, make the presence
of leucite easily determinable in many of these rocks by simple
inspection, especially when the crystals are large. &ldquo;Pseudo-leucites&rdquo;
are rounded areas consisting of felspar, nepheline, analcite,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page504" id="page504"></a>504</span>
&amp;c., which have the shape, composition and sometimes even the
crystalline forms of leucite; they are probably pseudomorphs or
paramorphs, which have developed from leucite because this mineral,
in its isometric crystals, is not stable at ordinary temperatures and
may be expected under favourable conditions to undergo spontaneous
change into an aggregate of other minerals. Leucite is very often
accompanied by nepheline, sodalite or nosean; other minerals
which make their appearance with some frequency are melanite,
garnet and melilite.</p>

<p>The plutonic leucite-bearing rocks are leucite-syenite and missourite.
Of these the former consists of orthoclase, nepheline,
sodalite, diopside and aegirine, biotite and sphene. Two occurrences
are known, one in Arkansas, the other in Sutherlandshire,
Scotland. The Scottish rock has been called borolanite. Both
examples show large rounded spots in the hand specimens; they are
pseudo-leucites and under the microscope prove to consist of orthoclase,
nepheline, sodalite and decomposition products. These have
a radiate arrangement externally, but are of irregular structure at
their centres; it is interesting to note that in both rocks melanite
is an important accessory. The missourites are more basic and
consist of leucite, olivine, augite and biotite; the leucite is partly
fresh, partly altered to analcite, and the rock has a spotted character
recalling that of the leucite-syenites. It has been found only in the
Highwood Mountains of Montana.</p>

<p>The leucite-bearing dike-rocks are members of the tinguaite and
monchiquite groups. The leucite-tinguaites are usually pale grey
or greenish in colour and consist principally of nepheline, alkali-felspar
and aegirine. The latter forms bright green moss-like
patches and growths of indefinite shape, or in other cases scattered
acicular prisms, among the felspars and nephelines of the ground
mass. Where leucite occurs, it is always eumorphic in small,
rounded, many-sided crystals in the ground mass, or in larger masses
which have the same characters as the pseudo-leucites. Biotite
occurs in some of these rocks, and melanite also is present. Nepheline
appears to decrease in amount as leucite increases. Rocks of this
group are known from Rio de Janeiro, Arkansas, Kola (in Finland),
Montana and a few other places. In Greenland there are leucite-tinguaites
with much arfvedsonite (hornblende) and eudyalite.
Wherever they occur they accompany leucite- and nepheline-syenites.
Leucite-monchiquites are fine-grained dark rocks consisting
of olivine, titaniferous augite and iron oxides, with a glassy
ground mass in which small rounded crystals of leucite are scattered.
They have been described from Bohemia.</p>

<p>By far the greater number of the rocks which contain leucite are
lavas of Tertiary or recent geological age. They are never acid
rocks which contain quartz, but felspar is usually present, though
there are certain groups of leucite lavas which are non-felspathic.
Many of them also contain nepheline, sodalite, hauyne and nosean;
the much rarer mineral melilite appears also in some examples.
The commonest ferromagnesian mineral is augite (sometimes rich
in soda), with olivine in the more basic varieties. Hornblende
and biotite occur also, but are less common. Melanite is found in
some of the lavas, as in the leucite-syenites.</p>

<p>The rocks in which orthoclase (or sanidine) is present in considerable
amount are leucite-trachytes, leucite-phonolites and leucitophyres.
Of these groups the two former, which are not sharply
distinguished from one another by most authors, are common in
the neighbourhood of Rome (L. Bracciano, L. Bolsena). They are
of trachytic appearance, containing phenocysts of sanidine, leucite,
augite and biotite. Sodalite or hauyne may also be present, but
nepheline is typically absent. Rocks of this class occur also in the
tuffs of the Phlegraean Fields, near Naples. The leucitophyres are
rare rocks which have been described from various parts of the
volcanic district of the Rhine (Olbrück, Laacher See, &amp;c.) and from
Monte Vulture in Italy. They are rich in leucite, but contain also
some sanidine and often much nepheline with hauyne or nosean.
Their pyroxene is principally aegirine or aegirine augite; some of
them are rich in melanite. Microscopic sections of some of these
rocks are of great interest on account of their beauty and the variety
of felspathoid minerals which they contain. In Brazil leucitophyres
have been found which belong to the Carboniferous period.</p>

<p>Those leucite rocks which contain abundant essential plagioclase
felspar are known as leucite-tephrites and leucite-basanites. The
former consist mainly of plagioclase, leucite and augite, while the
latter contain olivine in addition. The leucite is often present in
two sets of crystals, both porphyritic and as an ingredient of the
ground mass. It is always idiomorphic with rounded outlines.
The felspar ranges from bytownite to oligoclase, being usually a
variety of labradorite; orthoclase is scarce. The augite varies a
good deal in character, being green, brown or violet, but aegirine
(the dark green pleochroic soda-iron-augite) is seldom present.
Among the accessory minerals biotite, brown hornblende, hauyne,
iron oxides and apatite are the commonest; melanite and nepheline
may also occur. The ground mass of these rocks is only occasionally
rich in glass. The leucite-tephrites and leucite-basanites of Vesuvius
and Somma are familiar examples of this class of rocks. They are
black or ashy-grey in colour, often vesicular, and may contain many
large grey phenocysts of leucite. Their black augite and yellow green
olivine are also easily detected in hand specimens. From Volcanello,
Sardinia and Roccamonfina similar rocks are obtained; they
occur also in Bohemia, in Java, Celebes, Kilimanjaro (Africa) and
near Trebizond in Asia Minor.</p>

<p>Leucite lavas from which felspar is absent are divided into the
leucitites and leucite basalts. The latter contain olivine, the former
do not. Pyroxene is the usual ferromagnesian mineral, and resembles
that of the tephrites and basanites. Sanidine, melanite, hauyne
and perofskite are frequent accessory minerals in these rocks, and
many of them contain melilite in some quantity. The well-known
leucitite of the Capo di Bove, near Rome, is rich in this mineral,
which forms irregular plates, yellow in the hand specimen, enclosing
many small rounded crystals of leucite. Bracciano and Roccamonfina
are other Italian localities for leucitite, and in Java, Montana,
Celebes and New South Wales similar rocks occur. The leucite-basalts
belong to more basic types and are rich in olivine and augite.
They occur in great numbers in the Rhenish volcanic district (Eifel,
Laacher See) and in Bohemia, and accompany tephrites or leucitites
in Java, Montana, Celebes and Sardinia. The &ldquo;peperino&rdquo; of the
neighbourhood of Rome is a leucitite tuff.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEUCTRA,<a name="ar10" id="ar10"></a></span> a village of Boeotia in the territory of Thespiae,
chiefly noticeable for the battle fought in its neighbourhood in
371 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> between the Thebans and the Spartans and their allies.
A Peloponnesian army, about 10,000 strong, which had invaded
Boeotia from Phocis, was here confronted by a Boeotian levy of
perhaps 6000 soldiers under Epaminondas (<i>q.v.</i>). In spite of
inferior numbers and the doubtful loyalty of his Boeotian allies,
Epaminondas offered battle on the plain before the town. Massing
his cavalry and the 50-deep column of Theban infantry on
his left wing, he sent forward this body in advance of his centre
and right wing. After a cavalry engagement in which the
Thebans drove their enemies off the field, the decisive issue was
fought out between the Theban and Spartan foot. The latter,
though fighting well, could not sustain in their 12-deep formation
the heavy impact of their opponents&rsquo; column, and were hurled
back with a loss of about 2000 men, of whom 700 were Spartan
citizens, including the king Cleombrotus. Seeing their right wing
beaten, the rest of the Peloponnesians retired and left the enemy
in possession of the field. Owing to the arrival of a Thessalian
army under Jason of Pherae, whose friendship they did not
trust, the Thebans were unable to exploit their victory. But
the battle is none the less of great significance in Greek history.
It marks a revolution in military tactics, affording the first
known instance of a deliberate concentration of attack upon the
vital point of the enemy&rsquo;s line. Its political effects were equally
far-reaching, for the loss in material strength and prestige which
the Spartans here sustained deprived them for ever of their
supremacy in Greece.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEUK<a name="ar11" id="ar11"></a></span> (Fr. <i>Loèche Ville</i>), an ancient and very picturesque
little town in the Swiss canton of the Valais. It is built above
the right bank of the Rhone, and is about 1 m. from the Leuk-Susten
station (15½ m. east of Sion and 17½ m. west of Brieg) on
the Simplon railway. In 1900 it had 1592 inhabitants, all but
wholly German-speaking and Romanists. About 10½ m. by a
winding carriage road N. of Leuk, and near the head of the Dala
valley, at a height of 4629 ft. above the sea-level, and overshadowed
by the cliffs of the Gemmi Pass (7641 ft.; <i>q.v.</i>) leading
over to the Bernese Oberland, are the Baths of Leuk (<i>Leukerbad</i>,
or <i>Loèche les Bains</i>). They have only 613 permanent inhabitants,
but are much frequented in summer by visitors (largely French
and Swiss) attracted by the hot mineral springs. These are 22
in number, and are very abundant. The principal is that of
St Laurence, the water of which has a temperature of 124° F.
The season lasts from June to September. The village in winter
is long deprived of sunshine, and is much exposed to avalanches,
by which it was destroyed in 1518, 1719 and 1756, but it is now
protected by a strong embankment from a similar catastrophe.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEUTHEN,<a name="ar12" id="ar12"></a></span> a village of Prussian Silesia, 10 m. W. of Breslau,
memorable as the scene of Frederick the Great&rsquo;s victory over the
Austrians on December 5, 1757. The high road from Breslau
to Lüben crosses the marshy Schweidnitz Water at Lissa,
and immediately enters the rolling country about Neumarkt.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page505" id="page505"></a>505</span>
Leuthen itself stands some 4000 paces south of the road, and a
similar distance south again lies Sagschütz, while Nypern, on
the northern edge of the hill country, is 5000 paces from the road.
On Frederick&rsquo;s approach the Austrians took up a line of battle
resting on the two last-named villages. Their whole position
was strongly garrisoned and protected by obstacles, and their
artillery was numerous though of light calibre. A strong outpost
of Saxon cavalry was in Borne to the westward. Frederick had
the previous day surprised the Austrian bakeries at Neumarkt,
and his Prussians, 33,000 to the enemy&rsquo;s 82,000, moved towards
Borne and Leuthen early on the 5th. The Saxon outpost was
rushed at in the morning mist, and, covered by their advanced
guard on the heights beyond, the Prussians wheeled to their
right. Prince Charles of Lorraine, the Austrian commander-in-chief,
on Leuthen Church tower, could make nothing of
Frederick&rsquo;s movements, and the commander of his right wing
(Lucchesi) sent him message after message from Nypem and
Gocklerwitz asking for help, which was eventually despatched.
But the real blow was to fall on the left under Nadasdy. While
the Austrian commander was thus wasting time, the Prussians
were marching against Nadasdy in two columns, which preserved
their distances with an exactitude which has excited the wonder
of modern generations of soldiers; at the due place they wheeled
into line of battle obliquely to the Austrian front, and in one
great <i>échelon</i>,&mdash;the cavalry of the right wing foremost, and that
of the left &ldquo;refused,&rdquo;&mdash;Frederick advanced on Sagschütz.
Nadasdy, surprised, put a bold face on the matter and made a
good defence, but he was speedily routed, and, as the Prussians
advanced, battalion after battalion was rolled up towards
Leuthen until the Austrians faced almost due south. The fighting
in Leuthen itself was furious; the Austrians stood, in places,
100 deep, but the disciplined valour of the Prussians carried
the village. For a moment the victory was endangered when
Lucchesi came down upon the Prussian left wing from the north,
but Driesen&rsquo;s cavalry, till then refused, charged him in flank
and scattered his troopers in wild rout. This stroke ended the
battle. The retreat on Breslau became a rout almost comparable
to that of Waterloo, and Prince Charles rallied, in Bohemia,
barely 37,000 out of his 82,000. Ten thousand Austrians were
left on the field, 21,000 taken prisoners (besides 17,000 in
Breslau a little later), with 51 colours and 116 cannon. The
Prussian loss in all was under 5500. It was not until 1854
that a memorial of this astonishing victory was erected on the
battlefield.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEVÉE<a name="ar18" id="ar18"></a></span> (from Fr. <i>lever</i>, to raise), an embankment which keeps a
river in its channel. A river such as the Mississippi (<i>q.v.</i>), draining
a large area, carries a great amount of sediment from its swifter
head-streams to the lower ground. As soon as a stream&rsquo;s velocity
is checked, it drops a portion of its load of sediment and spreads
an alluvial fan in the lower part of its course. This deposition
of material takes place particularly at the sides of the stream
where the velocity is least, and the banks are in consequence
raised above the main channel, so that the river becomes lifted
bodily upwards in its bed, and flows above the level of the
surrounding country. In flood-time the muddy water flows over
the river&rsquo;s banks, where its velocity is at once checked as it flows
gently down the outer side, causing more material to be deposited
there, and a long alluvial ridge, called a natural levée, to be built
up on either side of the stream. These ridges may be wide or
narrow, but they slope from the stream&rsquo;s outer banks to the
plain below, and in consequence require careful watching, for if
the levée is broken by a &ldquo;crevasse,&rdquo; the whole body of the river
may pour through and flood the country below. In 1890 the
Mississippi near New Orleans broke through the Nita crevasse
and flowed eastward with a current of 15 m. an hour, spreading
destruction in its path. The Hwang-ho river in China is
peculiarly liable to these inundations. The word levée is also
sometimes used to denote a riverside quay or landing-place.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEVEE<a name="ar19" id="ar19"></a></span> (from the French substantival use of <i>lever</i>, to rise;
there is no French substantival use of <i>levée</i> in the English sense),
a reception or assembly held by the British sovereign or his
representative, in Ireland by the lord-lieutenant, in India by the
viceroy, in the forenoon or early afternoon, at which men only are
present in distinction from a &ldquo;drawing-room,&rdquo; at which ladies
also are presented or received. Under the <i>ancien règime</i> in
France the <i>lever</i> of the king was regulated, especially under
Louis XIV., by elaborate etiquette, and the various divisions of
the ceremonial followed the stages of the king&rsquo;s rising from bed,
from which it gained its name. The <i>petit lever</i> began when the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page506" id="page506"></a>506</span>
king had washed and said his daily offices; to this were admitted
the princes of the blood, certain high officers of the household
and those to whom a special permit had been granted; then
followed the <i>première entrée</i>, to which came the secretaries and
other officials and those having the <i>entrée</i>; these were received
by the king in his dressing-gown. Finally, at the <i>grand lever</i>,
the remainder of the household, the nobles and gentlemen of the
court were received; the king by that time was shaved, had
changed his linen and was in his wig. In the United States the
term &ldquo;levee&rdquo; was formerly used of the public receptions held
by the president.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEVELLERS,<a name="ar20" id="ar20"></a></span> the name given to an important political party
in England during the period of the Civil War and the Commonwealth.
The germ of the Levelling movement must be sought
for among the Agitators (<i>q.v.</i>), men of strong republican views,
and the name Leveller first appears in a letter of the 1st of
November 1647, although it was undoubtedly in existence as a
nickname before this date (Gardiner, <i>Great Civil War</i>, iii. 380).
This letter refers to these extremists thus: &ldquo;They have given
themselves a new name, viz. Levellers, for they intend to
sett all things straight, and rayse a parity and community in
the kingdom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Levellers first became prominent in 1647 during the protracted
and unsatisfactory negotiations between the king and
the parliament, and while the relations between the latter and
the army were very strained. Like the Agitators they were
mainly found among the soldiers; they were opposed to the
existence of kingship, and they feared that Cromwell and the
other parliamentary leaders were too complaisant in their dealings
with Charles; in fact they doubted their sincerity in this
matter. Led by John Lilburne (<i>q.v.</i>) they presented a manifesto,
<i>The Case of the Army truly stated</i>, to the commander-in-chief, Lord
Fairfax, in October 1647. In this they demanded a dissolution
of parliament within a year and substantial changes in the constitution
of future parliaments, which were to be regulated by an
unalterable &ldquo;law paramount.&rdquo; In a second document, <i>The
Agreement of the People</i>, they expanded these ideas, which were
discussed by Cromwell, Ireton and other officers on the one side,
and by John Wildman, Thomas Rainsborough and Edward
Sexby for the Levellers on the other. But no settlement was
made; some of the Levellers clamoured for the king&rsquo;s death,
and in November 1647, just after his flight from Hampton Court
to Carisbrooke, they were responsible for a mutiny which broke
out in two regiments at Corkbush Field, near Ware. This,
however, was promptly suppressed by Cromwell. During the
twelve months which immediately preceded the execution of the
king the Levellers conducted a lively agitation in favour of the
ideas expressed in the <i>Agreement of the people</i>, and in January
1648 Lilburne was arrested for using seditious language at a
meeting in London. But no success attended these and similar
efforts, and their only result was that the Levellers regarded
Cromwell with still greater suspicion.</p>

<p>Early in 1649, just after the death of the king, the Levellers
renewed their activity. They were both numerous and dangerous,
and they stood up, says Gardiner, &ldquo;for an exaggeration
of the doctrine of parliamentary supremacy.&rdquo; In a pamphlet,
<i>England&rsquo;s New Chains</i>, Lilburne asked for the dissolution of the
council of state and for a new and reformed parliament. He
followed this up with the <i>Second Part of England&rsquo;s New Chains</i>;
his writings were declared treasonable by parliament, and in
March 1649 he and three other leading Levellers, Richard Overton,
William Walwyn and Prince were arrested. The discontent
which was spreading in the army was fanned when certain
regiments were ordered to proceed to Ireland, and in April 1649
there was a meeting in London; but this was quickly put down
by Fairfax and Cromwell, and its leader, Robert Lockyer, was
shot. Risings at Burford and at Banbury were also suppressed
without any serious difficulty, and the trouble with the Levellers
was practically over. Gradually they became less prominent,
but under the Commonwealth they made frequent advances to
the exiled king Charles II., and there was some danger from them
early in 1655 when Wildman was arrested and Sexby escaped
from England. The distinguishing mark of the Leveller was a
sea-green ribbon.</p>

<p>Another but more harmless form of the same movement was
the assembling of about fifty men on St George&rsquo;s Hill near
Oatlands in Surrey. In April 1649 these &ldquo;True Levellers&rdquo;
or &ldquo;Diggers,&rdquo; as they were called, took possession of some
unoccupied ground which they began to cultivate. They were,
however, soon dispersed, and their leaders were arrested and
brought before Fairfax, when they took the opportunity of
denouncing landowners. It is interesting to note that Lilburne
and his colleagues objected to being designated Levellers, as
they had no desire to take away &ldquo;the proper right and title that
every man has to what is his own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cromwell attacked the Levellers in his speech to parliament in
September 1654 (Carlyle, <i>Cromwell&rsquo;s Letters and Speeches</i>, Speech
II.). He said: &ldquo;A nobleman, a gentleman, a yeoman; the
distinction of these; that is a good interest of the nation, and
a great one. The &lsquo;natural&rsquo; magistracy of the nation, was it
not almost trampled under foot, under despite and contempt, by
men of Levelling principles? I beseech you, for the orders of
men and ranks of men, did not that Levelling principle tend to
the reducing of all to an equality? Did it &lsquo;consciously&rsquo; think
to do so; or did it &lsquo;only unconsciously&rsquo; practise towards that
for property and interest? &lsquo;At all events,&rsquo; what was the purport
of it but to make the tenant as liberal a fortune as the
landlord? Which, I think, if obtained, would not have lasted
long.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In 1724 there was a rising against enclosures in Galloway, and a
number of men who took part therein were called Levellers or Dyke-breakers
(A. Lang, <i>History of Scotland</i>, vol. iv.). The word was also
used in Ireland during the 18th century to describe a secret revolutionary
society similar to the Whiteboys.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEVEN, ALEXANDER LESLIE<a name="ar21" id="ar21"></a></span>, <span class="sc">1st Earl of</span> (<i>c.</i> 1580-1661),
Scottish general, was the son of George Leslie, captain of Blair-in-Athol,
and a member of the family of Leslie of Balquhain.
After a scanty education he sought his fortune abroad, and became
a soldier, first under Sir Horace Vere in the Low Countries, and
afterwards (1605) under Charles IX. and Gustavus Adolphus
of Sweden, in whose service he remained for many years and
fought in many campaigns with honour. In 1626 Leslie had
risen by merit to the rank of lieutenant-general, and had been
knighted by Gustavus. In 1628 he distinguished himself by his
constancy and energy in the defence of Stralsund against Wallenstein,
and in 1630 seized the island of Rügen in the name of
the king of Sweden. In the same year he returned to Scotland
to assist in recruiting and organizing the corps of Scottish
volunteers which James, 3rd marquis of Hamilton, brought
over to Gustavus in 1631. Leslie received a severe wound in
the following winter, but was able nevertheless to be present
at Gustavus&rsquo;s last battle at Lützen. Like many others of the
soldiers of fortune who served under Gustavus, Leslie cherished
his old commander&rsquo;s memory to the day of his death, and he
kept with particular care a jewel and miniature presented to him
by the king. He continued as a general officer in the Swedish
army for some years, was promoted in 1636 to the rank of field
marshal, and continued in the field until 1638, when events
recalled him to his own country. He had married long before
this&mdash;in 1637 his eldest son was made a colonel in the Swedish
army&mdash;and he had managed to keep in touch with Scottish
affairs.</p>

<p>As the foremost Scottish soldier of his day he was naturally
nominated to command the Scottish army in the impending
war with England, a post which, resigning his Swedish command,
he accepted with a glad heart, for he was an ardent Covenanter
and had caused &ldquo;a great number of our commanders in Germany
subscryve our covenant&rdquo; (Baillie&rsquo;s <i>Letters</i>). On leaving Sweden
he brought back his arrears of pay in the form of cannon and
muskets for his new army. For some months he busied himself
with the organization and training of the new levies, and with
inducing Scottish officers abroad to do their duty to their country
by returning to lead them. Diminutive in size and somewhat

and simple tact, combined with the respect for his office of lord
general that he enforced on all ranks, brought even the unruly
nobles to subordination. He had by now amassed a considerable
fortune and was able to live in a manner befitting a commander-in-chief,
even when in the field. One of his first exploits was to
take the castle of Edinburgh by surprise, without the loss of a
man. He commanded the Scottish army at Dunse Law in May
of that year, and in 1640 he invaded England, and defeated
the king&rsquo;s troops at Newburn on the Tyne, which gave him
possession of Newcastle and of the open country as far as the
Tees. At the treaty with the king at Ripon, Leslie was one of
the commissioners of the Scottish parliament, and when Charles
visited Edinburgh Leslie entertained him magnificently and
accompanied him when he drove through the streets. His
affirmations of loyalty to the crown, which later events caused
to be remembered against him, were sincere enough, but the
complicated politics of the time made it difficult for Leslie, the
lord general of the Scottish army, to maintain a perfectly
consistent attitude. However, his influence was exercised
chiefly to put an end to, even to hush up, the troubles, and he
is found, now giving a private warning to plotters against the
king to enable them to escape, now guarding the Scottish
parliament against a royalist <i>coup d&rsquo;état</i>, and now securing for
an old comrade of the German wars, Patrick Ruthven, Lord
Ettrick, indemnity for having held Edinburgh Castle for the
king against the parliament. Charles created him, by patent
dated Holyrood, October 11, 1641, earl of Leven and Lord
Balgonie, and made him captain of Edinburgh Castle and a
privy councillor. The parliament recognized his services by a
grant, and, on his resigning the lord generalship, appointed him
commander of the permanent forces. A little later, Leven, who
was a member of the committee of the estates which exercised
executive powers during the recess of parliament, used his great
influence in support of a proposal to raise a Scottish army to
help the elector palatine in Germany, but the Ulster massacres
gave this force, when raised, a fresh direction and Leven himself
accompanied it to Ireland as lord general. He did not remain
there long, for the Great Rebellion (<i>q.v.</i>) had begun in England,
and negotiations were opened between the English and the
Scottish parliaments for mutual armed assistance. Leven
accepted the command of the new forces raised for the invasion
of England, and was in consequence freely accused of having
broken his personal oath to Charles, but he could hardly have
acted otherwise than he did, and at that time, and so far as the
Scots were concerned, to the end of the struggle, the parliaments
were in arms, professedly and to some extent actually, to rescue
his majesty from the influence of evil counsellors.</p>

<p>The military operations preceding Marston Moor are described
under <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Great Rebellion</a></span>, and the battle itself under its own
heading. Leven&rsquo;s great reputation, wisdom and tact made him
an ideal commander for the allied army formed by the junction
of Leven&rsquo;s, Fairfax&rsquo;s and Manchester&rsquo;s in Yorkshire. After
the battle the allied forces separated, Leven bringing the siege
of Newcastle to an end by storming it. In 1645 the Scots were
less successful, though their operations ranged from Westmorland
to Hereford, and Leven himself had many administrative and
political difficulties to contend with. These difficulties became
more pronounced when in 1646 Charles took refuge with the
Scottish army. The king remained with Leven until he was
handed over to the English parliament in 1647, and Leven
constantly urged him to take the covenant and to make peace.
Presbyterians and Independents had now parted, and with
no more concession than the guarantee of the covenant the
Scottish and English Presbyterians were ready to lay down their
arms, or to turn them against the &ldquo;sectaries.&rdquo; Leven was now
old and infirm, and though retained as nominal commander-in-chief
saw no further active service. He acted with Argyll and
the &ldquo;godly&rdquo; party in the discussions preceding the second invasion
of England, and remained at his post as long as possible
in the hope of preventing the Scots becoming merely a royalist
instrument for the conquest of the English Independents.
But be was induced in the end to resign, though he was appointed
lord general of all new forces that might be raised for the defence
of Scotland. The occasion soon came, for Cromwell annihilated
the Scottish invaders at Preston and Uttoxeter, and thereupon
Argyll assumed political and Leven military control at Edinburgh.
But he was now over seventy years of age, and willingly resigned
the effective command to his subordinate David Leslie (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Newark, Lord</a></span>), in whom he had entire confidence. After the
execution of Charles I. the war broke out afresh, and this time
the &ldquo;godly&rdquo; party acted with the royalists. In the new war,
and in the disastrous campaign of Dunbar, Leven took but a
nominal part, though attempts were afterwards made to hold
him responsible. But once more the parliament refused to
accept his resignation. Leven at last fell into the hands of a
party of English dragoons in August 1651, and with some others
was sent to London. He remained incarcerated in the Tower
for some time, till released on finding securities for £20,000,
upon which he retired to his residence in Northumberland.
While on a visit to London he was again arrested, for a technical
breach of his engagement, but by the intercession of the queen
of Sweden he obtained his liberty. He was freed from his
engagements in 1654, and retired to his seat at Balgonie in
Fifeshire, where he died at an advanced age in 1661. He
acquired considerable landed property, particularly Inchmartin
in the Carse of Gowrie, which he called Inchleslie.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEVEN,<a name="ar22" id="ar22"></a></span> a police burgh of Fifeshire, Scotland. Pop. (1901)
5577. It is situated on the Firth of Forth, at the mouth of the
Leven, 5¾ m. E. by N. of Thornton Junction by the North
British railway. The public buildings include the town hall,
public hall and people&rsquo;s institute, in the grounds of which the
old town cross has been erected. The industries are numerous,
comprising flax-spinning, brewing, linen-weaving, paper-making,
seed-crushing and rope-making, besides salt-works, a foundry,
saw-mill and brick-works. The wet dock is not much used,
owing to the constant accumulation of sand. The golf-links
extending for 2 m. to Lundin are among the best in Scotland.
Two miles N.E. is Lundin Mill and Drumochie, usually called
<span class="sc">Lundin</span> (pop. 570), at the mouth of Kiel Burn, with a station on
the Links. The three famous standing stones are supposed to
be either of &ldquo;Druidical&rdquo; origin or to mark the site of a battle
with the Danes. In the vicinity are the remains of an old house
of the Lundins, dating from the reign of David II. To the N.W.
of Leven lies the parish of <span class="sc">Kennoway</span> (pop. 870). In Captain
Seton&rsquo;s house, which still stands in the village of Kennoway,
Archbishop Sharp spent the night before his assassination (1679).
One mile east of Lundin lies <span class="sc">Largo</span> (pop. of parish 2046),
consisting of Upper Largo, or Kirkton of Largo, and Lower
Largo. The public buildings include Simpson institute, with
a public hall, library, reading-room, bowling-green and lawn-tennis
court, and John Wood&rsquo;s hospital, founded in 1659 for
poor persons bearing his name. A statue of Alexander Selkirk,
or Selcraig (1676-1721), the prototype of &ldquo;Robinson Crusoe,&rdquo;
who was born here, was erected in 1886. Sir John Leslie (1766-1832),
the natural philosopher, was also a native. Largo claims
two famous sailors, Admiral Sir Philip Durham (1763-1845),
commander-in-chief at Portsmouth from 1836 to 1839, and
Sir Andrew Wood (d. 1515), the trusted servant of James III.
and James IV., who sailed the &ldquo;Great Michael,&rdquo; the largest ship
of its time. When he was past active service he had a canal
cut from his house to the parish church, to which he was rowed
every Sunday in an eight-oared barge. Largo House was granted
to him by James III., and the tower of the original structure still
exists. About 1½ m. from the coast rises the height of Largo Law
(948 ft.). Kellie Law lies some 5½ m. to the east.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEVEN, LOCH,<a name="ar23" id="ar23"></a></span> a lake of Kinross-shire, Scotland. It has an
oval shape, the longer axis running from N.W. to S.E., has a
length of 3<span class="spp">2</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span> m., and a breadth of 2<span class="spp">2</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span> m. and is situated near the
south and east boundaries of the shire. It lies at a height of 350 ft.
above the sea. The mean depth is less than 15 ft., with a
maximum of 83 ft., the lake being thus one of the shallowest
in Scotland. Reclamation works carried on from 1826 to 1836
reduced its area by one quarter, but it still possesses a surface
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page508" id="page508"></a>508</span>
area of 5½ sq. m. It drains the county and is itself drained by
the Leven. It is famous for the Loch Leven trout (<i>Salmo
levenensis</i>, considered by some a variety of <i>S. trutta</i>), which are
remarkable for size and quality. The fishings are controlled
by the Loch Leven Angling Association, which organizes competitions
attracting anglers from far and near. The loch contains
seven islands. Upon St Serf&rsquo;s, the largest, which commemorates
the patron saint of Fifeshire, are the ruins of the Priory of Portmoak&mdash;so
named from St Moak, the first abbot&mdash;the oldest
Culdee establishment in Scotland. Some time before 961 it
was made over to the bishop of St Andrews, and shortly after
1144 a body of canons regular was established on it in connexion
with the priory of canons regular founded in that year at St
Andrews. The second largest island, Castle Island, possesses
remains of even greater interest. The first stronghold is supposed
to have been erected by Congal, son of Dongart, king of the
Picts. The present castle dates from the 13th century and was
occasionally used as a royal residence. It is said to have been
in the hands of the English for a time, from whom it was delivered
by Wallace. It successfully withstood Edward Baliol&rsquo;s siege
in 1335, and was granted by Robert II. to Sir William Douglas
of Lugton. It became the prison at various periods of Robert II.;
of Alexander Stuart, earl of Buchan, &ldquo;the Wolf of Badenoch&rdquo;;
Archibald, earl of Douglas (1429); Patrick Graham, archbishop
of St Andrews (who died, still in bondage, on St Serf&rsquo;s Island in
1478), and of Mary, queen of Scots. The queen had visited it
more than once before her detention, and had had a presence
chamber built in it. Conveyed hither in June 1567 after her
surrender at Carberry, she signed her abdication within its walls
on the 4th of July and effected her escape on the 2nd of May 1568.
The keys of the castle, which were thrown into the loch during
her flight, were found and are preserved at Dalmahoy in Midlothian.
Support of Mary&rsquo;s cause had involved Thomas Percy,
7th earl of Northumberland (b. 1528). He too was lodged in
the castle in 1569, and after three years&rsquo; imprisonment was
handed over to the English, by whom he was beheaded at
York in 1572. The proverb that &ldquo;Those never got luck who
came to Loch Leven&rdquo; sums up the history of the castle. The
causeway connecting the isle with the mainland was long submerged
too deeply for use, but the reclamation operations already
referred to almost brought it into view again.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEVEN AND MELVILLE, EARLS OF.<a name="ar24" id="ar24"></a></span> The family of Melville
which now holds these two earldoms is descended from Sir John
Melville of Raith in Fifeshire. Sir John, who was a member of
the reforming party in Scotland, was put to death for high
treason on the 13th of December 1548; he left with other
children a son Robert (1527-1621), who in 1616 was created a lord
of parliament as Lord Melville of Monymaill. Before his elevation
to the Scottish peerage Melville had been a stout partisan
of Mary, queen of Scots, whom he represented at the English
court, and he had filled several important offices in Scotland
under her son James VI. The fourth holder of the lordship of
Melville was George (<i>c.</i> 1634-1707), a son of John, the 3rd lord
(d. 1643), and a descendant of Sir John Melville. Implicated in
the Rye House plot against Charles II., George took refuge in
the Netherlands in 1683, but he returned to England after the
revolution of 1688 and was appointed secretary for Scotland
by William III. in 1689, being created earl of Melville in the
following year. He was made president of the Scottish privy
council in 1696, but he was deprived of his office when Anne
became queen in 1702, and he died on the 20th of May 1707.
His son David, 2nd earl of Melville (1660-1728), fled to Holland
with his father in 1683; after serving in the army of the elector
of Brandenburg he accompanied William of Orange to England
in 1688. At the head of a regiment raised by himself he fought
for William at Killiecrankie and elsewhere, and as commander-in-chief
of the troops in Scotland he dealt promptly and effectively
with the attempted Jacobite rising of 1708. In 1712, however,
his office was taken from him and he died on the 6th of June
1728.</p>

<p>Alexander Leslie, 1st earl of Leven (<i>q.v.</i>), was succeeded in
his earldom by his grandson Alexander, who died without sons
in July 1664. The younger Alexander&rsquo;s two daughters were
then in turn countesses of Leven in their own right; and after the
death of the second of these two ladies in 1676 a dispute arose
over the succession to the earldom between John Leslie, earl
(afterwards duke) of Rothes, and David Melville, 2nd earl of
Melville, mentioned above. In 1681, however, Rothes died,
and Melville, who was a great-grandson of the 1st earl of Leven,
assumed the title, calling himself earl of Leven and Melville
after he succeeded his father as earl of Melville in May 1707.
Since 1805 the family has borne the name of Leslie-Melville.
In 1906 John David Leslie-Melville (b. 1886) became 12th earl
of Leven and 11th earl of Melville.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEVER, CHARLES JAMES<a name="ar25" id="ar25"></a></span> (1806-1872), Irish novelist, second
son of James Lever, a Dublin architect and builder, was born
in the Irish capital on the 31st of August 1806. His descent
was purely English. He was educated in private schools, where
he wore a ring, smoked, read novels, was a ringleader in every
breach of discipline, and behaved generally like a boy destined
for the navy in one of Captain Marryat&rsquo;s novels. His escapades
at Trinity College, Dublin (1823-1828), whence he took the
degree of M.B. in 1831, form the basis of that vast cellarage
of anecdote from which all the best vintages in his novels are
derived. The inimitable Frank Webber in <i>Charles O&rsquo;Malley</i>
(spiritual ancestor of Foker and Mr Bouncer) was a college
friend, Robert Boyle, later on an Irish parson. Lever and Boyle
sang ballads of their own composing in the streets of Dublin,
after the manner of Fergusson or Goldsmith, filled their caps
with coppers and played many other pranks embellished in the
pages of <i>O&rsquo;Malley</i>, <i>Con Cregan</i> and <i>Lord Kilgobbin</i>. Before
seriously embarking upon the medical studies for which he was
designed, Lever visited Canada as an unqualified surgeon on
an emigrant ship, and has drawn upon some of his experiences
in <i>Con Cregan</i>, <i>Arthur O&rsquo;Leary</i> and <i>Roland Cashel</i>. Arrived in
Canada he plunged into the backwoods, was affiliated to a tribe
of Indians and had to escape at the risk of his life, like his own
Bagenal Daly.</p>

<p>Back in Europe, he travelled in the guise of a student from
Göttingen to Weimar (where he saw Goethe), thence to Vienna;
he loved the German student life with its beer, its fighting and
its fun, and several of his merry songs, such as &ldquo;The Pope he
loved a merry life&rdquo; (greatly envied by Titmarsh), are on
<i>Student-lied</i> models. His medical degree admitted him to an
appointment from the Board of Health in Co. Clare and then
as dispensary doctor at Port Stewart, but the liveliness of his
diversions as a country doctor seems to have prejudiced the
authorities against him. In 1833 he married his first love,
Catherine Baker, and in February 1837, after varied experiences,
he began running <i>The Confessions of Harry Lorrequer</i> through
the pages of the recently established <i>Dublin University Magazine</i>.
During the previous seven years the popular taste had declared
strongly in favour of the service novel as exemplified by <i>Frank
Mildmay</i>, <i>Tom Cringle</i>, <i>The Subaltern</i>, <i>Cyril Thornton</i>, <i>Stories of
Waterloo</i>, <i>Ben Brace</i> and <i>The Bivouac</i>; and Lever himself
had met William Hamilton Maxwell, the titular founder of the
genre. Before <i>Harry Lorrequer</i> appeared in volume form (1839),
Lever had settled on the strength of a slight diplomatic connexion
as a fashionable physician in Brussels (16, Rue Ducale). <i>Lorrequer</i>
was merely a string of Irish and other stories good, bad and
indifferent, but mostly rollicking, and Lever, who strung together
his anecdotes late at night after the serious business of the day
was done, was astonished at its success. &ldquo;If this sort of thing
amuses them, I can go on for ever.&rdquo; Brussels was indeed a
superb place for the observation of half-pay officers, such as
Major Monsoon (Commissioner Meade), Captain Bubbleton and
the like, who terrorized the <i>tavernes</i> of the place with their
endless peninsular stories, and of English society a little damaged,
which it became the specialty of Lever to depict. He sketched
with a free hand, wrote, as he lived, from hand to mouth, and
the chief difficulty he experienced was that of getting rid of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page509" id="page509"></a>509</span>
characters who &ldquo;hung about him like those tiresome people
who never can make up their minds to bid you good night.&rdquo;
Lever had never taken part in a battle himself, but his next three
books, <i>Charles O&rsquo;Malley</i> (1841), <i>Jack Hinton</i> and <i>Tom Burke of
Ours</i> (1843), written under the spur of the writer&rsquo;s chronic
extravagance, contain some splendid military writing and some
of the most animated battle-pieces on record. In pages of
<i>O&rsquo;Malley</i> and <i>Tom Burke</i> Lever anticipates not a few of the best
effects of Marbot, Thiébaut, Lejeune, Griois, Seruzier, Burgoyne
and the like. His account of the Douro need hardly fear comparison,
it has been said, with Napier&rsquo;s. Condemned by the critics,
Lever had completely won the general reader from the Iron
Duke himself downwards.</p>

<p>In 1842 he returned to Dublin to edit the <i>Dublin University
Magazine</i>, and gathered round him a typical coterie of Irish
wits (including one or two hornets) such as the O&rsquo;Sullivans,
Archer Butler, W. Carleton, Sir William Wilde, Canon Hayman,
D. F. McCarthy, McGlashan, Dr Kenealy and many others. In
June 1842 he welcomed at Templeogue, 4 m. south-west of Dublin,
the author of the <i>Snob Papers</i> on his Irish tour (the <i>Sketch
Book</i> was, later, dedicated to Lever). Thackeray recognized
the fund of Irish sadness beneath the surface merriment. &ldquo;The
author&rsquo;s character is not humour but sentiment. The spirits
are mostly artificial, the <i>fond</i> is sadness, as appears to me to
be that of most Irish writing and people.&rdquo; The Waterloo
episode in <i>Vanity Fair</i> was in part an outcome of the talk
between the two novelists. But the &ldquo;Galway pace,&rdquo; the display
he found it necessary to maintain at Templeogue, the stable
full of horses, the cards, the friends to entertain, the quarrels
to compose and the enormous rapidity with which he had to
complete <i>Tom Burke</i>, <i>The O&rsquo;Donoghue</i> and <i>Arthur O&rsquo;Leary</i>
(1845), made his native land an impossible place for Lever to
continue in. Templeogue would soon have proved another
Abbotsford. Thackeray suggested London. But Lever required
a new field of literary observation and anecdote. His <i>sève
originel</i> was exhausted and he decided to renew it on the continent.
In 1845 he resigned his editorship and went back to Brussels,
whence he started upon an unlimited tour of central Europe
in a family coach. Now and again he halted for a few months,
and entertained to the limit of his resources in some ducal
castle or other which he hired for an off season. Thus at Riedenburg,
near Bregenz, in August 1846, he entertained Charles
Dickens and his wife and other well-known people. Like his
own <i>Daltons</i> or <i>Dodd Family Abroad</i> he travelled continentally,
from Carlsruhe to Como, from Como to Florence, from Florence
to the Baths of Lucca and so on, and his letters home are the
litany of the literary remittance man, his ambition now limited
to driving a pair of novels abreast without a diminution of his
standard price for serial work (&ldquo;twenty pounds a sheet&rdquo;).
In the <i>Knight of Gwynne</i>, a story of the Union (1847), <i>Con Cregan</i>
(1849), <i>Roland Cashel</i> (1850) and <i>Maurice Tiernay</i> (1852) we
still have traces of his old manner; but he was beginning to lose
his original joy in composition. His <i>fond</i> of sadness began to
cloud the animal joyousness of his temperament. Formerly
he had written for the happy world which is young and curly
and merry; now he grew fat and bald and grave. &ldquo;After 38
or so what has life to offer but one universal declension. Let
the crew pump as hard as they like, the leak gains every hour.&rdquo;
But, depressed in spirit as he was, his wit was unextinguished;
he was still the delight of the <i>salons</i> with his stories, and in 1867,
after a few years&rsquo; experience of a similar kind at Spezia, he was
cheered by a letter from Lord Derby offering him the more
lucrative consulship of Trieste. &ldquo;Here is six hundred a year for
doing nothing, and you are just the man to do it.&rdquo; The six
hundred could not atone to Lever for the lassitude of prolonged
exile. Trieste, at first &ldquo;all that I could desire,&rdquo; became with
characteristic abruptness &ldquo;detestable and damnable.&rdquo; &ldquo;Nothing
to eat, nothing to drink, no one to speak to.&rdquo; &ldquo;Of all the
dreary places it has been my lot to sojourn in this is the worst&rdquo;
(some references to Trieste will be found in <i>That Boy of Norcott&rsquo;s</i>,
1869). He could never be alone and was almost morbidly
dependent upon literary encouragement. Fortunately, like
Scott, he had unscrupulous friends who assured him that his
last efforts were his best. They include <i>The Fortunes of Glencore</i>
(1857), <i>Tony Butler</i> (1865), <i>Luttrell of Arran</i> (1865), <i>Sir Brooke
Fosbrooke</i> (1866), <i>Lord Kilgobbin</i> (1872) and the table-talk of
<i>Cornelius O&rsquo;Dowd</i>, originally contributed to Blackwood. His
depression, partly due to incipient heart disease, partly to the
growing conviction that he was the victim of literary and
critical conspiracy, was confirmed by the death of his wife
(23rd April 1870), to whom he was tenderly attached. He
visited Ireland in the following year and seemed alternately
in very high and very low spirits. Death had already given
him one or two runaway knocks, and, after his return to Trieste,
he failed gradually, dying suddenly, however, and almost
painlessly, from failure of the heart&rsquo;s action on the 1st of June
1872. His daughters, one of whom, Sydney, is believed to have
been the real author of <i>The Rent in a Cloud</i> (1869), were well
provided for.</p>

<p>Trollope praised Lever&rsquo;s novels highly when he said that they
were just like his conversation. He was a born raconteur, and
had in perfection that easy flow of light description which without
tedium or hurry leads up to the point of the good stories of which
in earlier days his supply seemed inexhaustible. With little
respect for unity of action or conventional novel structure, his
brightest books, such as <i>Lorrequer</i>, <i>O&rsquo;Malley</i> and <i>Tom Burke</i>, are
in fact little more than recitals of scenes in the life of a particular
&ldquo;hero,&rdquo; unconnected by any continuous intrigue. The type of
character he depicted is for the most part elementary. His
women are mostly rouées, romps or Xanthippes; his heroes have
too much of the Pickle temper about them and fall an easy prey
to the serious attacks of Poe or to the more playful gibes of
Thackeray in <i>Phil Fogarty</i> or Bret Harte in <i>Terence Deuville</i>.
This last is a perfect bit of burlesque. Terence exchanges
nineteen shots with the Hon. Captain Henry Somerset in the glen.
&ldquo;At each fire I shot away a button from his uniform. As my
last bullet shot off the last button from his sleeve, I remarked
quietly, &lsquo;You seem now, my lord, to be almost as ragged as the
gentry you sneered at,&rsquo; and rode haughtily away.&rdquo; And yet
these careless sketches contain such haunting creations as Frank
Webber, Major Monsoon and Micky Free, &ldquo;the Sam Weller of
Ireland.&rdquo; Falstaff is alone in the literature of the world; but
if ever there came a later Falstaff, Monsoon was the man. As
for Baby Blake, is she not an Irish Di Vernon? The critics may
praise Lever&rsquo;s thoughtful and careful later novels as they will,
but <i>Charles O&rsquo;Malley</i> will always be the pattern of a military
romance.</p>

<p>Superior, it is sometimes claimed, in construction and style,
the later books approximate it may be thought to the good
<i>ordinary</i> novel of commerce, but they lack the <i>extraordinary</i>
qualities, the incommunicable &ldquo;go&rdquo; of the early books&mdash;the
élan of Lever&rsquo;s untamed youth. Artless and almost formless
these productions may be, but they represent to us, as very few
other books can, that pathetic ejaculation of Lever&rsquo;s own&mdash;&ldquo;Give
us back the wild freshness of the morning!&rdquo; We know
the novelist&rsquo;s teachers, Maxwell, Napier, the old-fashioned compilation
known as <i>Victoires, conquêtes et désastres des Français</i>
(1835), and the old buffers at Brussels who emptied the room
by uttering the word &ldquo;Badajos.&rdquo; But where else shall we find
the equals of the military scenes in <i>O&rsquo;Malley</i> and <i>Tom Burke</i>,
or the military episodes in <i>Jack Hinton</i>, <i>Arthur O&rsquo;Leary</i> (the story
of Aubuisson) or <i>Maurice Tiernay</i> (nothing he ever did is finer
than the chapter introducing &ldquo;A remnant of Fontenoy&rdquo;)? It
is here that his true genius lies, even more than in his talent for
conviviality and fun, which makes an early copy of an early Lever
(with Phiz&rsquo;s illustrations) seem literally to exhale an atmosphere
of past and present entertainment. It is here that he is a true
romancist, not for boys only, but also for men.</p>

<p>Lever&rsquo;s lack of artistry and of sympathy with the deeper
traits of the Irish character have been stumbling-blocks to his
reputation among the critics. Except to some extent in <i>The
Martins of Cro&rsquo; Martin</i> (1856) it may be admitted that his portraits
of Irish are drawn too exclusively from the type depicted
in Sir Jonah Barrington&rsquo;s <i>Memoirs</i> and already well known on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page510" id="page510"></a>510</span>
the English stage. He certainly had no deliberate intention of
&ldquo;lowering the national character.&rdquo; Quite the reverse. Yet his
posthumous reputation seems to have suffered in consequence,
in spite of all his Gallic sympathies and not unsuccessful
endeavours to apotheosize the &ldquo;Irish Brigade.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEVERRIER, URBAIN JEAN JOSEPH<a name="ar27" id="ar27"></a></span> (1811-1877), French
astronomer, was born at St Lô in Normandy on the 11th of March
1811. His father, who held a small post under government,
made great efforts to send him to Paris, where a brilliant examination
gained him, in 1831, admittance to the École Polytechnique.
The distinction of his career there was rewarded with a free
choice amongst the departments of the public service open to
pupils of the school. He selected the administration of tobaccos,
addressing himself especially to chemical researches under the
guidance of Gay-Lussac, and gave striking proof of ability in
two papers on the combinations of phosphorus with hydrogen
and oxygen, published in <i>Annales de Chimie et de Physique</i>
(1835 and 1837). His astronomical vocation, like that of Kepler,
came from without. The place of teacher of that science at the
École Polytechnique falling vacant in 1837, it was offered to
and accepted by Leverrier, who, &ldquo;docile to circumstance,&rdquo;
instantly abandoned chemistry, and directed the whole of his
powers to celestial mechanics. The first fruits of his labours
were contained in two memoirs presented to the Academy,
September 16 and October 14, 1839. Pursuing the investigations
of Laplace, he demonstrated with greater rigour the stability of
the solar system, and calculated the limits within which the
eccentricities and inclinations of the planetary orbits vary. This
remarkable début excited much attention, and, on the recommendation
of François Arago, he took in hand the theory of
Mercury, producing, in 1843, vastly improved tables of that
planet. The perturbations of the comets discovered, the one by
H. A. E. A. Faye in November 1843, the other by Francesco de
Vico a year later, were minutely investigated by Leverrier, with
the result of disproving the supposed identity of the first with
Lexell&rsquo;s lost comet of 1770, and of the other with Tycho&rsquo;s of
1585. On the other hand, he made it appear all but certain that
Vico&rsquo;s comet was the same with one seen by Philippe de Lahire
in 1678. Recalled once more, by the summons of Arago, to
planetary studies, he was this time invited to turn his attention
to Uranus. Step by step, with sagacious and patient accuracy,
he advanced to the great discovery which has immortalized his
name. Carefully sifting all the known causes of disturbance, he
showed that one previously unknown had to be reckoned with,
and on the 23rd of September 1846 the planet Neptune was
discerned by J. G. Galle (d. 1910) at Berlin, within one degree of
the spot Leverrier had indicated (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Neptune</a></span>).</p>

<p>This memorable achievement was greeted with an outburst
of public enthusiasm. Academies vied with each other in enrolling
Leverrier among their members; the Royal Society
awarded him the Copley medal; the king of Denmark sent him
the order of the Dannebrog; he was named officer in the Legion
of Honour, and preceptor to the comte de Paris; a chair of
astronomy was created for his benefit at the Faculty of Sciences;
he was appointed adjunct astronomer to the Bureau of Longitudes.
Returned to the Legislative Assembly in 1849 by his
native department of Manche, he voted with the anti-republican
party, but devoted his principal attention to subjects connected
with science and education. After the <i>coup d&rsquo;état</i> of 1851 he
became a senator and inspector-general of superior instruction,
sat upon the commission for the reform of the École Polytechnique
(1854), and, on the 30th of January 1854, succeeded
Arago as director of the Paris observatory. His official work in
the latter capacity would alone have strained the energies of an
ordinary man. The institution had fallen into a state of lamentable
inefficiency. Leverrier placed it on a totally new footing,
freed it from the control of the Bureau of Longitudes, and raised
it to its due rank among the observatories of Europe. He did
not escape the common lot of reformers. His uncompromising
measures and unconciliatory manner of enforcing them raised a
storm only appeased by his removal on the 5th of February 1870.
On the death of his successor Charles Eugène Delaunay (1816-1872),
he was reinstated by Thiers, but with authority restricted
by the supervision of a council. In the midst of these disquietudes,
he executed a task of gigantic proportions. This was
nothing less than the complete revision cf the planetary theories,
followed by a laborious comparison of results with the most
authentic observations, and the construction of tables representing
the movements thus corrected. It required all his indomitable
perseverance to carry through a purpose which failing
health continually menaced with frustration. He had, however,
the happiness of living long enough to perfect his work. Three
weeks after he had affixed his signature to the printed sheets of
the theory of Neptune he died at Paris on the 23rd of September
1877. By his marriage with Mademoiselle Choquet, who survived
him little more than a month, he left a son and daughter.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The discovery with which Leverrier&rsquo;s name is popularly identified
was only an incident in his career. The elaboration of the scheme of
the heavens traced out by P. S. Laplace in the <i>Mécanique céleste</i>
was its larger aim, for the accomplishment of which forty years of
unremitting industry barely sufficed. He nevertheless found time
to organize the meteorological service in France and to promote the
present system of international weather-warnings. He founded the
Association Scientifique, and was active in introducing a practical
scientific element into public education. His inference of the existence,
between Mercury and the sun, of an appreciable quantity of
circulating matter (<i>Comptes rendus</i>, 1859, ii. 379), has not yet
been verified. He was twice, in 1868 and 1876, the recipient of the
gold medal of the Royal Astronomical Society, London, and the
university of Cambridge conferred upon him, in 1875, the honorary
degree of LL.D. His planetary and solar tables were adopted by the
<i>Nautical Almanac</i>, as well as by the <i>Connaissance des temps</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Annales de l&rsquo;Observatoire de Paris</i>, the publication of which
was set on foot by Leverrier, contain, in vols. i.-vi. (<i>Mémoires</i>)
(1855-1861) and x.-xiv. (1874-1877), his theories and tables of the
several planets. In vol. i. will be found, besides his masterly report
on the observatory, a general theory of secular inequalities, in which
the development of the disturbing function was carried further than
had previously been attempted.</p>

<p>The memoirs and papers communicated by him to the Academy
were summarized in <i>Comptes rendus</i> (1839-1876), and the more important
published in full either separately or in the <i>Conn. des temps</i>
and the <i>Journal des mathématiques</i>. That entitled <i>Développemens
sur différents points de la théorie des perturbations</i> (1841), was translated

<p><span class="bold">LEVERTIN, OSCAR IVAN<a name="ar28" id="ar28"></a></span> (1862-1906), Swedish poet and
man of letters, was born of Jewish parents at Norrköping on the
17th of July 1862. He received his doctorate in letters at Upsala
in 1887, and was subsequently <i>docent</i> at Upsala, and later professor
of literature at Stockholm. Enforced sojourns in southern
Europe on account of health familiarized him with foreign
languages. He began by being an extreme follower of the naturalist
school, but on his return in 1890 from a two years&rsquo; residence
in Davos he wrote, in collaboration with the poet C. G. Verner
von Heidenstam (b. 1859), a novel, <i>Pepitas bröllop</i> (1890), which
was a direct attack on naturalism. His later volumes of short
stories, <i>Rococonoveller</i> and <i>Sista noveller</i>, are fine examples of
modern Swedish fiction. The lyrical beauty of his poems,
<i>Legender och visor</i> (1891), placed him at the head of the romantic
reaction in Sweden. In his poems entitled <i>Nya Dikter</i> (1894)
he drew his material partly from medieval sources, and a third
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page511" id="page511"></a>511</span>
volume of poetry in 1902 sustained his reputation. His last
poetical work (1905) was <i>Kung Salomo och Morolf</i>, poems founded
on an eastern legend. As a critic he first attracted attention by
his books on the Gustavian age of Swedish letters: <i>Teater och
drama under Gustaf III.</i> (1889), &amp;c. He was an active collaborator
in the review <i>Ord och Bild</i>. He died in 1906, at a time
when he was engaged on his <i>Linné</i>, posthumously published,

was born at Giessen on the 7th of November 1839, and was the
son of a Jewish rabbi. He was educated at Giessen and Mannheim,
and came under Vincenz Lachner&rsquo;s notice. From 1855 to
1858 Levi studied at the Leipzig conservatorium, and after a
series of travels which took him to Paris, he obtained his first
post as music director at Saarbrücken, which post he exchanged
for that at Mannheim in 1861. From 1862 to 1864 he was chief
conductor of the German opera in Rotterdam, then till 1872
at Carlsruhe, when he went to Munich, a post he held until 1896,
when ill-health compelled him to resign. Levi&rsquo;s name is indissolubly
connected with the increased public appreciation of
Wagner&rsquo;s music. He conducted the first performance of <i>Parsifal</i>
at Bayreuth in 1882, and was connected with the musical life
of that place during the remainder of his career. He visited
London in 1895.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEVI, LEONE<a name="ar30" id="ar30"></a></span> (1821-1888), English jurist and statistician,
was born of Jewish parents on the 6th of June 1821, at Ancona,
Italy. After receiving an early training in a business house in
his native town, he went to Liverpool in 1844, became naturalized,
and changing his faith, joined the Presbyterian church. Perceiving
the necessity, in view of the unsystematic condition of
the English law on the subject, for the establishment of chambers
and tribunals of commerce in England, he warmly advocated
their institution in numerous pamphlets; and as a result of his
labours the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce, of which Levi was
made secretary, was founded in 1849. In 1850 Levi published
his <i>Commercial Law of the World</i>, being an exhaustive and comparative
treatise upon the laws and codes of mercantile countries.
Appointed in 1852 to the chair of commercial law in King&rsquo;s
College, London, he proved himself a highly competent and
popular instructor, and his evening classes were a most successful
innovation. He was called to the bar at Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn in 1859,
and received from the university of Tübingen the degree of
doctor of political science. His chief work&mdash;<i>History of British
Commerce and of the Economic Progress of the British Nation</i>,
1763-1870, is perhaps a rather too partisan account of British
economic development, being a eulogy upon the blessings of
Free Trade, but its value as a work of reference cannot be
gainsaid. Among his other works are: <i>Work and Pay</i>; <i>Wages
and Earnings of the Working Classes</i>; <i>International Law, with
Materials for a Code</i>. He died on the 7th of May 1888.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEVIATHAN,<a name="ar31" id="ar31"></a></span> the Hebrew name (<i>livy&#257;th&#257;n</i>), occurring in the
poetical books of the Bible, of a gigantic animal, apparently
the sea or water equivalent of behemoth (<i>q.v.</i>), the king of the
animals of the dry land. In Job xli. 15 it would seem to represent
the crocodile, in Isaiah xxvii. 1 it is a crooked and piercing
serpent, the dragon of the sea; cf. Psalms civ. 26. The etymology
of the word is uncertain, but it has been taken to be connected
with a root meaning &ldquo;to twist.&rdquo; Apart from its scriptural
usage, the word is applied to any gigantic marine animal such
as the whale, and hence, figuratively, of very large ships, and
also of persons of outstanding strength, power, wealth or influence.
Hobbes adopted the name as the title of his principal work,
applying it to &ldquo;the multitude so united in one person ... called
a commonwealth.... This is the generation of that Leviathan,
or rather ... of that mortal God, to which we owe under the
immortal God, our peace and defence.&rdquo;</p>


<div class="center ptb6"><img style="width:200px; height:36px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img000.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p><span class="bold">LEVIRATE<a name="ar32" id="ar32"></a></span> (Lat. <i>levir</i>, a husband&rsquo;s brother), a custom,
sometimes even a law, compelling a dead man&rsquo;s brother to
marry his widow. It seems to have been widespread in primitive
times, and is common to-day. Of the origin and primitive
purpose of the levirate marriage various explanations have been
put forward:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. It has been urged that the custom was primarily based on
the law of inheritance; a wife, regarded as a chattel, being
inherited like other possessions. The social advantage of providing
one who should maintain the widow doubtless aided the
spread of the custom. The abandonment of a woman and her
children in the nomadic stage of civilization would be equivalent
to death for them; hence with some peoples the levirate
became a duty rather than a right. Among the Thlinkets,
for example, when a man dies, his brother or his sister&rsquo;s son
must marry the widow, a failure in this duty occasioning
feuds. The obligation on a man to provide for his sister-in-law
is analogous to other duties devolving on kinsfolk, such as the
vendetta.</p>

<p>2. J. F. McLennan, however, would assume the levirate to be
a relic of polyandry, and in his argument lays much stress on the
fact that it is the dead man&rsquo;s <i>brother</i> who inherits the widow.
But among many races who follow the custom, such as the
Fijians, Samoans, Papuans of New Guinea, the Caroline Islanders,
and some tribes in the interior of Western Equatorial Africa, the
rule of inheritance is to the brother first. Thus among the
Santals, &ldquo;when the elder brother dies, the next younger inherits
the widow, children and all the property.&rdquo; Further, there is
no known race where it is permitted to a son to marry his own
mother. Inheriting a woman in primitive societies would be
always tantamount to marrying her, and, apart from any special
laws of inheritance, it would be natural for the brother to take
over the widow. In polygamous countries where a man leaves
many widows the son would have a right of ownership over
these, and could dispose of them or keep them as he pleased, his
own mother alone excepted. Thus among the Bakalai, an
African tribe, widows may marry the son of their dead husband,
or in default of a son, can live with the brother. The Negroes
of Benin and the Gabun and the Kaffirs of Natal have similar
customs. In New Caledonia every man, married or single,
must immediately marry his brother&rsquo;s widow. In Polynesia the
levirate has the force of law, and it is common throughout
America and Asia.</p>

<p>3. Another explanation of the custom has been sought in a
semi-religious motive which has had extraordinary influence in
countries where to die without issue is regarded as a terrible
calamity. The fear of this catastrophe would readily arise
among people who did not believe in personal immortality, and
to whom the extinction of their line would be tantamount to
annihilation. Or it is easily conceivable as a natural result of
ancestor-worship, under which failure of offspring entailed
deprivation of cherished rites and service.<a name="fa1a" id="fa1a" href="#ft1a"><span class="sp">1</span></a> Thus it is only when
the dead man has no offspring that the Jewish, Hindu and
Malagasy laws prescribe that the brother shall &ldquo;raise up seed&rdquo;
to him. In this sense the levirate forms part of the Deuteronomic
Code, under which, however, the obligation is restricted to the
brother who &ldquo;dwelleth together&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i> on the family estate)
with the dead man, and the first child only of the levirate
marriage is regarded as that of the dead man. That the custom
was obsolescent seems proved by the enjoining of ceremony on
any brother who wished to evade the duty, though he had to
submit to an insult from his sister-in-law, who draws off his
sandal and spits in his face. The biblical story of Ruth exemplifies
the custom, though with further modifications (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Ruth, Book of</a></span>). Finally the custom is forbidden in Leviticus,
though in New Testament times the levirate law was still observed
by some Jews. The ceremony ordained by Deuteronomy is still
observed among the orthodox. Among the Hindus the <i>levir</i> did
not take his brother&rsquo;s widow as wife, but he had intercourse with
her. This practice was called <i>niyoga</i>.</p>

<p>4. Yet another suggested origin of the levirate is agrarian,
the motive being to keep together under the levirate husband the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page512" id="page512"></a>512</span>
property which would otherwise have been divided among all the
brothers or next of kin.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEVITES,<a name="ar34" id="ar34"></a></span> or sons of Levi (son of Jacob by Leah), a sacred
caste in ancient Israel, the guardians of the temple service at
Jerusalem.<a name="fa1b" id="fa1b" href="#ft1b"><span class="sp">1</span></a></p>

<p>1. <i>Place in Ritual.</i>&mdash;In the developed hierarchical system the
ministers of the sanctuary are divided into distinct grades.
All are &ldquo;Levites&rdquo; by descent, and are thus correlated in the
genealogical and other lists, but the true priesthood is confined
to the sons of Aaron, while the mass of the Levites are subordinate
servants who are not entitled to approach the altar or to perform
any strictly priestly function. All access to the Deity is restricted
to the one priesthood and to the one sanctuary at Jerusalem;
the worshipping subject is the nation of Israel as a unity, and the
function of worship is discharged on its behalf by divinely chosen
priests. The ordinary individual may not intrude under penalty
of death; only those of Levitical origin may perform service,
and they are essentially the servants and hereditary serfs of the
Aaronite priests (see Num. xviii.). But such a scheme finds no
place in the monarchy; it presupposes a hierocracy under which
the priesthood increased its rights by claiming the privileges
which past kings had enjoyed; it is the outcome of a complicated
development in Old Testament religion in the light of which it is
to be followed (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Hebrew Religion</a></span>).</p>

<p>First (<i>a</i>), in the earlier biblical writings which describe the state
of affairs under the Hebrew monarchy there is not this fundamental
distinction among the Levites, and, although a list of
Aaronite high-priests is preserved in a late source, internal
details and the evidence of the historical books render its value
extremely doubtful (1 Chron. vi. 3-15, 49-53). In Jerusalem
itself the subordinate officers of the temple were not members
of a holy gild, but of the royal body-guard, or bond-slaves who
had access to the sacred courts, and might even be uncircumcised
foreigners (Josh. ix. 27; 1 Kings xiv. 28; 2 Kings xi.; cf. Zeph.
i. 8 seq.; Zech. xiv. 21). Moreover, ordinary individuals might
serve as priests (1 Sam. ii II, 18, vii. 1; see 2 Sam. viii. 18,
deliberately altered in 1 Chron. xviii. 17); however, every Levite
was a priest, or at least qualified to become one (Deut. x. 8,
xviii. 7; Judges xvii. 5-13), and when the author of 1 Kings xii. 31,
wishes to represent Jeroboam&rsquo;s priests as illegitimate, he does
not say that they were not Aaronites, but that they were not of
the sons of Levi.</p>

<p>The next stage (<i>b</i>) is connected with the suppression of the
local high-places or minor shrines in favour of a central sanctuary.
This involved the suppression of the Levitical priests in the
country (cf. perhaps the allusion in Deut. xxi. 5); and the present
book of Deuteronomy, in promulgating the reform, represents
the Levites as poor scattered &ldquo;sojourners&rdquo; and recommends
them to the charity of the people (Deut. xii. 12, 18 seq., xiv. 27,
29, xvi. 11, 14, xxvi. 11 sqq.). However, they are permitted to
congregate at &ldquo;the place which Yahweh shall choose,&rdquo; where
they may perform the usual priestly duties together with their
brethren who &ldquo;stand there before Yahweh,&rdquo; and they are
allowed their share of the offerings (Deut. xviii. 6-8).<a name="fa2b" id="fa2b" href="#ft2b"><span class="sp">2</span></a> The
Deuteronomic history of the monarchy actually ascribes to the
Judaean king Josiah (621 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) the suppression of the high-places,
and states that the local priests were brought to Jerusalem and
received support, but did not minister at the altar (2 Kings
xxiii. 9). Finally, a scheme of ritual for the second temple raises
this exclusion to the rank of a principle. The Levites who had
been idolatrous are punished by exclusion from the proper
priestly work, and take the subordinate offices which the uncircumcised
and polluted foreigners had formerly filled, while the
sons of Zadok, who had remained faithful, are henceforth the
legitimate priests, the only descendants of Levi who are allowed
to minister unto Yahweh (Ezek. xliv. 6-15, cf. xl. 46, xliii. 19,
xlviii. 11). &ldquo;A threefold cord is not quickly broken,&rdquo; and these
three independent witnesses agree in describing a significant
innovation which ends with the supremacy of the Zadokites of
Jerusalem over their brethren.</p>

<p>In the last stage (<i>c</i>) the exclusion of the ordinary Levites from
all share in the priesthood of the sons of Aaron is looked upon as
a matter of course, dating from the institution of priestly worship
by Moses. The two classes are supposed to have been founded
separately (Exod. xxviii., cf. xxix. 9; Num. iii. 6-10), and so far
from any degradation being attached to the rank and file of the
Levites, their position is naturally an honourable one compared
with that of the mass of non-Levitical worshippers (see Num.
i. 50-53), and they are taken by Yahweh as a surrogate
for the male first-born of Israel (iii. 11-13). They are inferior
only to the Aaronites to whom they are &ldquo;joined&rdquo; (xviii. 2, a play
on the name Levi) as assistants. Various adjustments and
modifications still continue, and a number of scattered details
may indicate that internal rivalries made themselves felt. But
the different steps can hardly be recovered clearly, although the
fact that the priesthood was extended beyond the Zadokites to
families of the dispossessed priests points to some compromise
(1 Chron. xxiv.). Further, it is subsequently found that certain
classes of temple servants, the singers and porters, who had once
been outside the Levitical gilds, became absorbed as the term
&ldquo;Levite&rdquo; was widened, and this change is formally expressed by
the genealogies which ascribe to Levi, the common &ldquo;ancestor&rdquo;
of them all, the singers and even certain families whose heathenish
and foreign names show that they were once merely servants
of the temple.<a name="fa3b" id="fa3b" href="#ft3b"><span class="sp">3</span></a></p>

<p>2. <i>Significance of the Development.</i>&mdash;Although the legal basis
for the final stage is found in the legislation of the time of Moses
(latter part of the second millennium <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), it is in reality scarcely
earlier than the 5th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, and the Jewish theory finds
analogies when developments of the Levitical service are referred
to David (1 Chron. xv. seq., xxiii. sqq.), Hezekiah (2 Chron. xxix.)
and Josiah (xxxv.)&mdash;contrast the history in the earlier books of
Samuel and Kings&mdash;or when the still later book of Jubilees
(xxxii.) places the rise of the Levitical priesthood in the patriarchal
period. The traditional theory of the Mosaic origin of the
elaborate Levitical legislation cannot be maintained save by
the most arbitrary and inconsequential treatment of the evidence
and by an entire indifference to the historical spirit; and,
although numerous points of detail still remain very obscure, the
three leading stages in the Levitical institutions are now recognized
by nearly all independent scholars. These stages with a
number of concomitant features confirm the literary hypothesis
that biblical history is in the main due to two leading recensions,
the Deuteronomic and the Priestly (cf. [<i>b</i>] and [<i>c</i>] above), which
have incorporated older sources.<a name="fa4b" id="fa4b" href="#ft4b"><span class="sp">4</span></a> If the hierarchical system as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page513" id="page513"></a>513</span>
it existed in the post-exilic age was really the work of Moses,
it is inexplicable that all trace of it was so completely lost that
the degradation of the non-Zadokites in Ezekiel was a new
feature and a punishment, whereas in the Mosaic law the
ordinary Levites, on the traditional view, was already forbidden
priestly rights under penalty of death. There is in fact no clear
evidence of the existence of a distinction between priests and
Levites in any Hebrew writing demonstrably earlier than the
Deuteronomic stage, although, even as the Pentateuch contains
ordinances which have been carried back by means of a &ldquo;legal
convention&rdquo; to the days of Moses, writers have occasionally
altered earlier records of the history to agree with later
standpoints.<a name="fa5b" id="fa5b" href="#ft5b"><span class="sp">5</span></a></p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>No argument in support of the traditional theory can be drawn
from the account of Korah&rsquo;s revolt (Num. xvi. sqq., see § 3) or from
the Levitical cities (Num. xxxv.; Josh. xxi.). Some of the latter
were either not conquered by the Israelites until long after the invasion,
or, if conquered, were not held by Levites; and names are
wanting of places in which priests are actually known to have lived.
Certainly the names are largely identical with ancient holy cities,
which, however, are holy because they possessed noted shrines,
not because the inhabitants were members of a holy tribe. Gezer
and Taanach, for example, are said to have remained in the hands of
Canaanites (Judges i. 27, 29; cf. 1 Kings ix. 16), and recent excavation
has shown how far the cultus of these cities was removed from Mosaic
religion and ritual and how long the grosser elements persisted.<a name="fa6b" id="fa6b" href="#ft6b"><span class="sp">6</span></a>
On the other hand, the sanctuaries obviously had always their local
ministers, all of whom in time could be called Levitical, and it is
only in this sense, not in that of the late priestly legislation, that a
place like Shechem could ever have been included. Further, instead
of holding cities and pasture-grounds, the Levites are sometimes
described as scattered and divided (Gen. xlix. 7; Deut. xviii. 6),
and though they may naturally possess property as private individuals,
they alone of all the tribes of Israel possess no tribal inheritance
(Num. xviii. 23, xxvi. 62; Deut. x. 9; Josh. xiv. 3). This
fluctuation finds a parallel in the age at which the Levites were to
serve; for neither has any reasonable explanation been found on
the traditional view. Num. iv. 3 fixes the age at thirty, although
in i. 3 it has been reduced to twenty; but in 1 Chron. xxiii. 3,
David is said to have numbered them from the higher limit, whereas
in <i>vv.</i> 24, 27 the lower figure is given on the authority of &ldquo;the last
words (or acts) of David.&rdquo; In Num. viii. 23-26, the age is given
as twenty-five, but twenty became usual and recurs in Ezra iii. 8
and 2 Chron. xxxi. 17. There are, however, independent grounds
for believing that 1 Chron. xxiii. 24, 27, 2 Chron. xxxi. 17 belong to
later insertions and that Ezr. iii. 8 is relatively late.</p>
</div>

<p>When, in accordance with the usual methods of Hebrew
genealogical history, the Levites are defined as the descendants
of Levi, the third son of Jacob by Leah (Gen. xxix. 34), a literal
interpretation is unnecessary, and the only narrative wherein
Levi appears as a person evidently delineates under the form
of personification events in the history of the Levites (Gen.
xxxiv.).<a name="fa7b" id="fa7b" href="#ft7b"><span class="sp">7</span></a> They take their place in Israel as the tribe set apart
for sacred duties, and without entering into the large question
how far the tribal schemes can be used for the earlier history
of Israel, it may be observed that no adequate interpretation
has yet been found of the ethnological traditions of Levi and
other sons of Leah in their historical relation to one another or to
the other tribes. However intelligible may be the notion of a
tribe <i>reserved</i> for priestly service, the fact that it does not apply
to early biblical history is apparent from the heterogeneous
details of the Levitical divisions. The incorporation of singers
and porters is indeed a late process, but it is typical of the
tendency to co-ordinate all the religious classes (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Genealogy</a></span>:
<i>Biblical</i>). The genealogies in their complete form pay little
heed to Moses, although Aaron and Moses could typify the
priesthood and other Levites generally (1 Chron. xxiii. 14).
Certain priesthoods in the first stage (§ 1 [<i>a</i>]) claimed descent
from these prototypes, and it is interesting to observe (1) the
growing importance of Aaron in the later sources of &ldquo;the
Exodus,&rdquo; and (2) the relation between Mosheh (Moses) and his
two sons Gershom and Eliezer, on the one side, and the Levitical
names Mushi (<i>i.e.</i> the Mosaite), Gershon and the Aaronite
priest Eleazar, on the other. There are links, also, which unite
Moses with Kenite, Rechabite, Calebite and Edomite families,
and the Levitical names themselves are equally connected with
the southern tribes of Judah and Simeon and with the Edomites.<a name="fa8b" id="fa8b" href="#ft8b"><span class="sp">8</span></a>
It is to be inferred, therefore, that some relationship subsisted,
or was thought to subsist, among (1) the Levites, (2) clans actually
located in the south of Palestine, and (3) families whose names
and traditions point to a southern origin. The exact meaning
of these features is not clear, but if it be remembered (<i>a</i>) that the
Levites of post-exilic literature represent only the result of a long
and intricate development, (<i>b</i>) that the name &ldquo;Levite,&rdquo; in the
later stages at least, was extended to include all priestly servants,
and (<i>c</i>) that the priesthoods, in tending to become hereditary,
included priests who were Levites by adoption and not by
descent, it will be recognized that the examination of the evidence
for the earlier stages cannot confine itself to those narratives
where the specific term alone occurs.</p>

<p>3. <i>The Traditions of the Levites.</i>&mdash;In the &ldquo;Blessing of Moses&rdquo;
(Deut, xxxiii. 8-11), Levi is a collective name for the priesthood,
probably that of (north) Israel. He is the guardian of the sacred
oracles, knowing no kin, and enjoying his privileges for proofs
of fidelity at Massah and Meribah. That these places (in the
district of Kadesh) were traditionally associated with the origin
of the Levites is suggested by various Levitical stories, although
it is in a narrative now in a context pointing to Horeb or Sinai
that the Levites are Israelites who for some cause (now lost)
severed themselves from their people and took up a stand
on behalf of Yahweh (Exod. xxxii.). Other evidence allows
us to link together the Kenites, Calebites and Danites in a
tradition of some movement into Palestine, evidently quite
distinct from the great invasion of Israelite tribes which predominates
in the existing records. The priesthood of Dan
certainly traced its origin to Moses (Judges xvii. 9, xviii. 30); that
of Shiloh claimed an equally high ancestry (1 Sam. ii. 27 seq.).<a name="fa9b" id="fa9b" href="#ft9b"><span class="sp">9</span></a>
Some tradition of a widespread movement appears to be
ascribed to the age of Jehu, whose accession, promoted by the
prophet Elisha, marks the end of the conflict between Yahweh
and Baal. To a Rechabite (the clan is allied to the Kenites)
is definitely ascribed a hand in Jehu&rsquo;s sanguinary measures,
and, though little is told of the obviously momentous events, one
writer clearly alludes to a bloody period when reforms were to
be effected by the sword (1 Kings xix. 17). Similarly the story
of the original selection of the Levites in the wilderness mentions
an uncompromising massacre of idolaters. Consequently,
it is very noteworthy that popular tradition preserves the
recollection of some attack by the &ldquo;brothers&rdquo; Levi and Simeon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page514" id="page514"></a>514</span>
upon the famous holy city of Shechem to avenge their
&ldquo;sister&rdquo; Dinah (Gen. xxxiv.), and that a detailed narrative
tells of the bloodthirsty though pious Danites who sacked an
Ephraimite shrine on their journey to a new home (Judges
xvii. sq.).</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The older records utilized by the Deuteronomic and later compilers
indicate some common tradition which has found expression in these
varying forms. Different religious standpoints are represented in
the biblical writings, and it is now important to observe that the
prophecies of Hosea unmistakably show another attitude to the
Israelite priesthood. The condemnation of Jehu&rsquo;s bloodshed (Hos.
i. 4) gives another view of events in which both Elijah and Elisha
were concerned, and the change is more vividly realized when it is
found that even to Moses and Aaron, the traditional founders of
Israelite religion and ritual, is ascribed an offence whereby they
incurred Yahweh&rsquo;s wrath (Num. xx. 12, 24, xxvii. 14; Deut. ix. 20,
xxxii. 51). The sanctuaries of Shiloh and Dan lasted until the
deportation of Israel (Judges xviii. 30 seq.), and some of their history
is still preserved in the account of the late pre-monarchical age
(12th-11th centuries <span class="scs">B.C.</span>). Shiloh&rsquo;s priestly gild is condemned for its
iniquity (1 Sam. iii. 11-14), the sanctuary mysteriously disappears,
and the priests are subsequently found at Nob outside Jerusalem
(1 Sam. xxi. seq.). All idea of historical perspective has been lost,
since the fall of Shiloh was apparently a recent event at the close of
the 7th century (Jer. vii. 12-15, xxvi. 6-9). But the tendency to
ascribe the disasters of northern Israel to the priesthood (see esp.
Hosea) takes another form when an inserted prophecy revokes the
privileges of the ancient and honourable family, foretells its overthrow,
and announces the rise of a new faithful and everlasting
priesthood, at whose hands the dispossessed survivors, reduced to
poverty, would beg some priestly office to secure a livelihood (1 Sam.
ii. 27-36). The sequel to this phase is placed in the reign of Solomon,
when David&rsquo;s old priest Abiathar, sole survivor of the priests of
Shiloh, is expelled to Anathoth (near Jerusalem), and Zadok becomes
the first chief priest contemporary with the foundation of the <i>first</i>
temple (1 Kings ii. 27, 35). These situations cannot be severed from
what is known elsewhere of the Deuteronomic teaching, of the reform
ascribed to Josiah, or of the principle inculcated by Ezekiel (see
§ 1 [<i>b</i>]). The late specific tendency in favour of Jerusalem agrees
with the Deuteronomic editor of Kings who condemns the sanctuaries
of Dan and Bethel for calf-worship (1 Kings xii. 28-31), and does not
acknowledge the northern priesthood to be Levitical (1 Kings xii. 31,
note the interpretation in 2 Chron. xi. 14, xiii. 9). It is from a similar
standpoint that Aaron is condemned for the manufacture of the
golden calf, and a compiler (not the original writer) finds its sequel
in the election of the faithful Levites.<a name="fa10b" id="fa10b" href="#ft10b"><span class="sp">10</span></a></p>
</div>

<p>In the third great stage there is another change in the tone.
The present (priestly) recension of Gen. xxxiv. has practically
justified Levi and Simeon from its standpoint of opposition to
intermarriage, and in spite of Jacob&rsquo;s curse (Gen. xlix. 5-7)
later traditions continue to extol the slaughter of the Shechemitcs
as a pious duty. Post-exilic revision has also hopelessly obscured
the offence of Moses and Aaron, although there was already a
tendency to place the blame upon the people (Deut. i. 37, iii. 26,
iv. 21). When two-thirds of the priestly families are said to be
Zadokites and one-third are of the families of Abiathar, some
reconciliation, some adjustment of rivalries, is to be recognized
(1 Chron. xxiv.). Again, in the composite story of Korah&rsquo;s
revolt, one version reflects a contest between Aaronites and the
other Levites who claimed the priesthood (Num. xvi. 8-11, 36-40),
while another shows the supremacy of the Levites as a caste either
over the rest of the people (? cf. the prayer, Deut. xxxiii. 11),
or, since the latter are under the leadership of Korah, later the
eponym of a gild of singers, perhaps over the more subordinate
ministers who once formed a separate class.<a name="fa11b" id="fa11b" href="#ft11b"><span class="sp">11</span></a> In the composite
work Chronicles-Ezra-Nehemiah (dating after the post-exilic
Levitical legislation) a peculiar interest is taken in the Levites,
more particularly in the singers, and certain passages even reveal
some animus against the Aaronites (2 Chron. xxix. 34, xxx. 3).
A Levite probably had a hand in the work, and this, with
the evidence for the Levitical Psalms (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Psalms</a></span>), gives the
caste an interesting place in the study of the transmission of
the biblical records.<a name="fa12b" id="fa12b" href="#ft12b"><span class="sp">12</span></a> But the history of the Levites in the early
post-exilic stage and onwards is a separate problem, and the work
of criticism has not advanced sufficiently for a proper estimate
of the various vicissitudes. However, the feeling which was
aroused among the priests when some centuries later the singers
obtained from Agrippa the privilege of wearing the priestly linen
dress (Josephus, <i>Ant.</i> xx. 9. 6), at least enables one to appreciate
more vividly the scantier hints of internal jealousies during the
preceding years.<a name="fa13b" id="fa13b" href="#ft13b"><span class="sp">13</span></a></p>

<p>4. <i>Summary.</i>&mdash;From the inevitable conclusion that there are
three stages in the written sources for the Levitical institutions,
the next step is the correlation of allied traditions on the basis
of the genealogical evidence. But the problem of fitting these
into the history of Israel still remains. The assumption that
the earlier sources for the pre-monarchical history, as incorporated
by late compilers, are necessarily trustworthy confuses the inquiry
(on Gen. xxxiv., see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Simeon</a></span>), and even the probability of a
reforming spirit in Jehu&rsquo;s age depends upon the internal criticism
of the related records (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Jews</a></span>, §§ 11-14). The view that the
Levites came from the south may be combined with the conviction
that there Yahweh had his seat (cf. Deut. xxxiii. 2;
Judges v. 4; Hab. iii. 3), but the latter is only one view, and the
traditions of the patriarchs point to another belief (cf. also
Gen. iv. 26). The two are reconciled when the God of the
patriarchs reveals His name for the first time unto Moses (Exod.
iii. 15, vi. 3). With these variations is involved the problem of
the early history of the Israelites.<a name="fa14b" id="fa14b" href="#ft14b"><span class="sp">14</span></a> Moreover, the real Judaean
tendency which associates the fall of Eli&rsquo;s priesthood at Shiloh
with the rise of the Zadokites involves the literary problems of
Deuteronomy, a composite work whose age is not certainly
known, and of the twofold Deuteronomic redaction elsewhere,
one phase of which is more distinctly Judaean and anti-Samaritan.
There are vicissitudes and varying standpoints which point to a
complicated literary history and require some historical background,
and, apart from actual changes in the history of the
Levites, some allowance must be made for the real character
of the circles where the diverse records originated or through
which they passed. The key must be sought in the exilic
and post-exilic age where, unfortunately, direct and decisive
evidence is lacking. It is clear that the Zadokite priests were
rendered legitimate by finding a place for their ancestor in the
Levitical genealogies&mdash;through Phinehas (cf. Num. xxv. 12 seq.),
and Aaron&mdash;there was a feeling that a legitimate priest must
be an Aaronite, but the historical reason for this is uncertain
(see R. H. Kennett, <i>Journ. Theolog. Stud.</i>, 1905, pp. 161 sqq.).
Hence, it is impossible at present to trace the earlier steps which
led to the grand hierarchy of post-exilic Judaism. Even the
name Levite itself is of uncertain origin. Though popularly
connected with <i>l&#257;v&#257;h</i>, &ldquo;be joined, attached,&rdquo; an ethnic from
Leah has found some favour; the Assyrian <i>l&#299;&rsquo;u</i> &ldquo;powerful,
wise,&rdquo; has also been suggested. The term has been more
plausibly identified with <i>l-v-</i>&rsquo; (fem. <i>l-v-&rsquo;-t</i>), the name given in old
Arabian inscriptions (<i>e.g.</i> at al-&lsquo;Ol&#257;, south-east of Elath) to the
priests and priestesses of the Arabian god Vadd (so especially
Hommel, <i>Anc. Heb. Trad.</i>, pp. 278 seq.). The date of the evidence,
however, has not been fixed with unanimity, and this very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page515" id="page515"></a>515</span>
attractive and suggestive view requires confirmation and
independent support.</p>

cult included the worship of a brazen serpent, the institution of

Kings, Hezekiah was the first to destroy it when he suppressed
idolatrous worship in Judah (2 Kings xviii. 4). It may be added that
the faithful Kenites (found in N. Palestine, Judges iv. 11) appear in
another light when threatened with captivity by Asshur (Num. xxiv.
22; cf. fall of Dan and Shiloh), and if their eponym is Cain (<i>q.v.</i>),

k&#333;h&#259;n&#299;m</i> (<span title="Totath kohanim">&#1514;&#1493;&#1512;&#1514; &#1499;&#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;</span>, law of the priests), <i>S&#275;pher k&#333;h&#259;n&#299;m</i> (<span title="Sepher k'">&#1505;&#1508;&#1512; &#1499;&#1524;</span>,
book of the priests), and <i>S&#275;pher &#7731;orb&#257;n&#299;m</i> (<span title="Sepher korbanim">&#1505;&#1508;&#1512; &#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;</span>, book of
offerings). As a descriptive title <i>Leviticus</i>, &ldquo;the Levitical
book,&rdquo; is not inappropriate to the contents of the book, which
exhibits an elaborate system of sacrificial worship. In this
connexion, however, the term &ldquo;Levitical&rdquo; is used in a perfectly
general sense, since there is no reference in the book itself to the
Levites themselves.</p>

<p>The book of Leviticus presents a marked contrast to the two
preceding books of the Hexateuch in that it is derived from one
document only, viz. the Priestly Code (P), and contains no trace
of the other documents from which the Hexateuch has been
compiled. Hence the dominant interest is a priestly one, while
the contents are almost entirely legislative as opposed to historical.
But though the book as a whole is assigned to a single
document, its contents are by no means homogeneous: in fact
the critical problem presented by the legislative portions of
Leviticus, though more limited in scope, is very similar to that
of the other books of the Hexateuch. Here, too, the occurrence
of repetitions and divergencies, the variations of standpoint and
practice, and, at times, the linguistic peculiarities point no less
clearly to diversity of origin.</p>

<p>The historical narrative with which P connects his account
of the sacred institutions of Israel is reduced in Leviticus to a
minimum, and presents no special features. The consecration
of Aaron and his sons (viii. ix.) resumes the narrative of Exod.
xl., and this is followed by a brief notice of the death of Nadab
and Abihu (x. 1-5), and later by an account of the death of the
blasphemer (xxiv. 10 f.). Apart from these incidents, which,
in accordance with the practice of P, are utilized for the purpose
of introducing fresh legislation, the book consists of three main
groups or collections of ritual laws: (1) chaps, i.-vii., laws of
sacrifice; (2) chaps, xi.-xv., laws of purification, with an appendix
(xvi.) on the Day of Atonement; (3) chaps, xvii.-xxvi.,
the Law of Holiness, with an appendix (xxvii.) on vows and
tithes. In part these laws appear to be older than P, but when
examined in detail the various collections show unmistakably
that they have undergone more than one process of redaction
before they assumed the form in which they are now presented.
The scope of the present article does not permit of an elaborate
analysis of the different sections, but the evidence adduced will,
it is hoped, afford sufficient proof of the truth of this statement.</p>

<p>I. <i>The Laws of Sacrifice.</i>&mdash;Chaps. i.-vii. This group of laws
clearly formed no part of the original narrative of P since it
interrupts the connexion of chap. viii. with Exod. xl. For chap.
viii. describes how Moses carried out the command of Exod. xl.
12-15 in accordance with the instructions given in Exod. xxix.
1-35, and bears the same relation to the latter passage that
Exod. xxxv. ff. bears to Exod. xxv. ff. Hence we can only conclude
that Lev. i.-vii. were added by a later editor. This conclusion
does not necessarily involve a late date for the laws themselves,
many of which have the appearance of great antiquity,
though their original form has been considerably modified. But
though these chapters form an independent collection of laws, and
were incorporated as such in P, a critical analysis of their contents
shows that they were not all derived from the same source.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The collection falls into two divisions, (<i>a</i>) i.-vi. 7 (Heb. v. 26), and
(<i>b</i>) vi. 8 (Heb. vi. 1)-vii., the former being addressed to the people
and the latter to the priests. The laws contained in (<i>a</i>) refer to (1)
burnt-offerings, i.; (2) meal-offerings, ii.; (3) peace-offerings, iii.;
(4) sin-offerings, iv. (on v. 1-13 see below); (5) trespass-offerings,
v. 14-vi. 7 (Heb. v. 14-26). The laws in (<i>b</i>) cover practically the
same ground&mdash;(1) burnt-offerings, vi. 8-13 (Heb. <i>vv.</i> 1-6); (2) meal-offerings,
vi. 14-18 (Heb. <i>vv.</i> 7-11); (3) the meal-offering of the priest,
vi. 19-23 (Heb. <i>vv.</i> 12-16); (4) sin-offerings, vi. 24-30 (Heb. <i>vv.</i> 17-23);
(5) trespass-offerings, vii. 1-7, together with certain regulations
for the priest&rsquo;s share of the burnt- and meal-offerings (<i>vv.</i> 8-10);
(6) peace-offerings, vii. 11-21. Then follow the prohibition of eating
the fat or blood (<i>vv.</i> 22-28), the priest&rsquo;s share of the peace-offerings
(<i>vv.</i> 29-34), the priest&rsquo;s anointing-portion (<i>vv.</i> 35, 36), and the subscription
(<i>vv.</i> 37, 38). The second group of laws is thus to a certain
extent supplementary to the first, and was, doubtless, intended as
such by the editor of chaps. i.-vii. Originally it can hardly have
formed part of the same collection; for (<i>a</i>) the order is different,
that of the second group being supported by its subscription, and
(<i>b</i>) the laws in vi. 8-vii. are regularly introduced by the formula
&ldquo;This is the law (<i>t&#333;rah</i>) of....&rdquo; Most probably the second group
was excerpted by the editor of chaps. i.-vii. from another collection
for the purpose of supplementing the laws of i.-v., more especially on
points connected with the functions and dues of the officiating priests.</p>

<p>Closer investigation, however, shows that both groups of laws
contain heterogeneous elements and that their present form is the
result of a long process of development. Thus i. and iii. seem to
contain genuinely old enactments, though i. 14-17 is probably a later
addition, since there is no reference to birds in the general heading
<i>v.</i> 2. Chap. ii. 1-3, on the other hand, though it corresponds in form to
i. and iii., interrupts the close connexion between those chapters, and
should in any case stand after iii.: the use of the second for the third
person in the remaining verses points to a different source. As might
be expected from the nature of the sacrifice with which it deals, iv.
(sin-offerings) seems to belong to a relatively later period of the
sacrificial system. Several features confirm this view: (1) the blood
of the sin-offering of the &ldquo;anointed priest&rdquo; and of the whole congregation
is brought within the veil and sprinkled on the altar of
incense, (2) the sin-offering of the congregation is a bullock, and
not, as elsewhere, a goat (ix. 15; Num. xv. 24), (3) the altar of
incense is distinguished from the altar of burnt-offering (as opposed
to Exod. xxix.; Lev. viii. ix.). Chap. v. 1-13 have usually been
regarded as an appendix to iv., setting forth (<i>a</i>) a number of typical
cases for which a sin-offering is required (<i>vv.</i> 1-6), and (<i>b</i>) certain concessions
for those who could not afford the ordinary sin-offering
(<i>vv.</i> 7-13). But <i>vv.</i> 1-6, which are not homogeneous (<i>vv.</i> 2 and 3
treating of another question and interrupting <i>vv.</i> 1, 4, 5 f.), cannot
be ascribed to the same author as iv.: for (1) it presents a different
theory of the sin-offering (contrast v. 1 f. with iv. 2), (2) it ignores
the fourfold division of offerings corresponding to the rank of the
offender, (3) it fails to observe the distinction between sin- and
trespass-offering (in <i>vv.</i> 6, 7, &ldquo;his guilt-offering&rdquo; (<span title="ashamo">&#1488;&#1513;&#1502;&#1493;</span>) appears to
have the sense of a &ldquo;penalty&rdquo; or &ldquo;forfeit,&rdquo; unless with Baentsch
we read <span title="korbano">&#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1504;&#1493;</span> &ldquo;his oblation&rdquo; in each case; cf. <i>v.</i> 11, iv. 23 ff.
Verses 7-13, on the other hand, form a suitable continuation of iv.,
though probably they are secondary in character. Chap. v. 14
(Heb. v. 26)-vi. 7 contain regulations for the trespass-offering, in
which the distinctive character of that offering is clearly brought
out. The cases cited in vi. 1-7 (Heb. v. 20-26) are clearly analogous
to those in v. 14-16, from which they are at present separated by
<i>vv.</i> 17-19. These latter prescribe a trespass-offering for the same
case for which in iv. 22 f. a sin-offering is required: it is noticeable
also that no restitution, the characteristic feature of the <i>&#257;sh&#257;m</i>, is
prescribed. It is hardly doubtful that the verses are derived from a
different source to that of their immediate context, possibly the
same as v. 1-6.</p>

<p>The subscription (vii. 37, 38) is our chief guide to determining the
original extent of the second group of laws (vi. 8 [Heb. vi. 1]-vii. 36).
From it we infer that originally the collection only dealt with the
five chief sacrifices (vi. 8-13; 14-18; 24, 25, 27-30; vii. 1-6; 11-21)
already discussed in i.-v., since only these are referred to in the
colophon where they are given in the same order (the consecration-offering
[<i>v.</i> 37] is probably due to the same redactor who introduced
the gloss &ldquo;in the day when he is anointed&rdquo; in vi. 20). Of the
remaining sections vi. 19-23 (Heb. 12-16), the daily meal-offering of
the (high-) priest, betrays its secondary origin by its absence from
the subscription, cf. also the different introduction. Chaps. vi.
26 (Heb. 19) and vii. 7 assign the offering to the officiating
priest in contrast to vi. 18 (Heb. 11), 29 (Heb. 22), vii. 6 (&ldquo;every
male among the priests&rdquo;), and possibly belong, together with vii.
8-10, to a separate collection which dealt especially with priestly
dues. Chap. vii. 22-27, which prohibit the eating of fat and blood,
are addressed to the community at large, and were, doubtless,
inserted here in connexion with the sacrificial meal which formed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page516" id="page516"></a>516</span>
the usual accompaniment of the peace-offering. Chap. vii. 28-34
are also addressed to the people, and cannot therefore have formed
part of the original priestly manual; <i>v.</i> 33 betrays the same hand as
vi. 26 (Heb. 19) and vii. 7, and with 35<i>a</i> may be assigned to the same
collection as those verses; to the redactor must be assigned <i>vv.</i> 32
(a doublet of <i>v.</i> 33), 34, 35<i>b</i> and 36.</p>

<p>Chaps. viii.-x. As stated, these chapters form the original sequel
to Exod. xl. They describe (<i>a</i>) the consecration of Aaron and his sons,
a ceremony which lasted seven days (viii.), and (<i>b</i>) the public worship
on the eighth day, at which Aaron and his sons officiated for the
first time as priests (ix.); then follow (<i>c</i>) an account of the death of
Nadab and Abihu for offering strange fire (x. 1-5); (<i>d</i>) various
regulations affecting the priests (<i>vv.</i> 12-15), and (<i>e</i>) an explanation,
in narrative form, of the departure in ix. 15 from the rules for the
sin-offering given in vi. 30 (<i>vv.</i> 16-20).</p>

<p>According to Exod. xl. 1-15 Moses was commanded to set up the
Tabernacle and to consecrate the priests, and the succeeding verses
(16-38) describe how the former command was carried out. The
execution of the second command, however, is first described in
Lev. viii., and since the intervening chapters exhibit obvious traces
of belonging to another source, we may conclude with some certainty
that Lev. viii. formed the immediate continuation of Exod. xl. in
the original narrative of P. But it has already been pointed out
(see Exodus) that Exod. xxxv.-xl. belong to a later stratum of P
than Exod. xxv.-xxix, hence it is by no means improbable that
Exod. xxxv-xl. have superseded an earlier and shorter account of
the fulfilment of the commands in Exod. xxv.-xxix. If this be the
case, we should naturally expect to find that Lev. viii., which bears
the same relation to Exod. xxix. 1-35 as Exod. xxxv. ff. to Exod.
xxv. ff. also belonged to a later stratum. But Lev. viii., unlike
Exod xxxv. ff., only mentions one altar, and though in its present
form the chapter exhibits marks of later authorship, these marks
form no part of the original account, but are clearly the work of a
later editor. These additions, the secondary character of which is
obvious both from the way in which they interrupt the context and
also from their contents, are (1), <i>v.</i> 10, the anointing of the Tabernacle
in accordance with Exod. xxx. 26 ff.: it is not enjoined in Exod.
xxix.; (2) <i>v.</i> 11, the anointing of the altar and the laver (cf. Exod.
xxx. 17 ff.) as in Exod. xxix. 36<i>b</i>, xxx. 26 ff.; (3) <i>v.</i> 30, the sprinkling
of blood and oil on Aaron and his sons. Apart from these secondary
elements, which readily admit of excision, the chapter is in complete
accord with P as regards point of view and language, and is therefore
to be assigned to that source.</p>

<p>The consecration of Aaron and his sons was, according to P, a
necessary preliminary to the offering of sacrifice, and chap. ix.
accordingly describes the first solemn act of worship. The ceremony
consists of (<i>a</i>) the offerings for Aaron, and (<i>b</i>) those for the congregation;
then follows the priestly blessing (v. 22), after which Moses
and Aaron enter the sanctuary, and on reappearing once more bless
the people. The ceremony terminates with the appearance of the
glory of Yahweh, accompanied by a fire which consumes the sacrifices
on the altar. Apart from a few redactional glosses the chapter
as a whole belongs to P. The punishment of Nadab and Abihu by
death for offering &ldquo;strange fire&rdquo; (x. 1-5) forms a natural sequel to
chap. ix. To this incident a number of disconnected regulations
affecting the priests have been attached, of which the first, viz. the
prohibition of mourning to Aaron and his sons (<i>vv.</i> 6, 7), alone has
any connexion with the immediate context; as it stands, the passage
is late in form (cf. xxi. 10 ff.). The second passage, <i>vv.</i> 8, 9, which
prohibits the use of wine and strong drink to the priest when on duty,
is clearly a later addition. The connexion between these verses and
the following is extremely harsh, and since <i>vv.</i> 10, 11 relate to an
entirely different subject (cf. xi. 47), the latter verses must be regarded
as a misplaced fragment. Verses 12-15 relate to the portions
of the meal- and peace-offerings which fell to the lot of the priests,
and connect, therefore, with chap. ix.; possibly they have been
wrongly transferred from that chapter. In the remaining paragraph,
x. 16-20, we have an interesting example of the latest type
of additions to the Hexateuch. According to ix. 15 (cf. <i>v.</i> 11) the
priests had burnt the flesh of the sin-offering which had been offered
on behalf of the congregation, although its blood had not been taken
into the inner sanctuary (cf. iv. 1-21, vi. 26). Such treatment, though
perfectly legitimate according to the older legislation (Exod. xxix. 14;
cf. Lev. viii. 17), was in direct contradiction to the ritual of vi. 24 ff.,
which prescribed that the flesh of ordinary sin-offerings should be
eaten by the priests. Such a breach of ritual on the part of Aaron
and his sons seemed to a later redactor to demand an explanation,
and this is furnished in the present section.</p>
</div>

<p>II. <i>The Laws of Purification.</i>&mdash;Chaps. xi.-xv. This collection
of laws comprises four main sections relating to (1) clean and
unclean beasts (xi.), (2) childbirth (xii.), (3) leprosy (xiii. xiv.),
and (4) certain natural secretions (xv.). These laws, or <i>t&#333;r&#333;th</i>,
are so closely allied to each other by the nature of their contents
and their literary form (cf. especially the recurring formula
&ldquo;This is the law of ...&rdquo; xi. 46, xii. 7, xiii. 59, xiv. 32, 54, 57,
xv. 32) that they must originally have formed a single collection.
The collection, however, has clearly undergone more than one
redaction before reaching its final form. This is made evident
not only by the present position of chap. xii. which in v. 2 presupposes
chap. xv. (cf. xv. 19), and must originally have followed
after that chapter, but also by the contents of the different
sections, which exhibit clear traces of repeated revision. At
the same time it seems, like chaps. i.-vii., xvii.-xxvi., to have
been formed independently of P and to have been added to that
document by a later editor; for in its present position it interrupts
the main thread of P&rsquo;s narrative, chap. xvi. forming the
natural continuation of chap. x.; and, further, the inclusion
of Aaron as well as Moses in the formula of address (xi. 1, xiii. 1,
xiv. 33, xv. 1) is contrary to the usage of P.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>1. Chap. xi. consists of two main sections, of which the first
(<i>vv.</i> 1-23, 41-47) contains directions as to the clean and unclean
animals which may or may not be used for food, while the second
(vv: 24-40) treats of the defilement caused by contact with the
carcases of unclean animals (in <i>v.</i> 39 f. contact with clean animals
after death is also forbidden), and prescribes certain rites of purification.
The main interest of the chapter, from the point of view of
literary criticism, centres in the relation of the first section to the
Law of Holiness (xvii.-xxvi.) and to the similar laws in Deut. xiv.
3-20. From xx. 25 it has been inferred with considerable probability
that H, or the Law of Holiness, originally contained legislation of a
similar character with reference to clean and unclean animals;
and many scholars have held that the first section (<i>vv.</i> 1 [or 2]-23
and 41-47) really belongs to that code. But while <i>vv.</i> 43-45 may
unhesitatingly be assigned to H, the remaining verses fail to exhibit
any of the characteristic features of that code. We must assign
them, therefore, to another source, though, in view of xx. 25 and
xi. 43-45, it is highly probable that they have superseded similar
legislation belonging to H.</p>

<p>The relation of Lev. xi. 2-23 to Deut. xiv. 4-20 is less easy to
determine, since the phenomena presented by the two texts are
somewhat inconsistent. The two passages are to a large extent
verbally identical, but while Deut. xiv. 4<i>b</i>, 5 both defines and
exemplifies the clean animals (as opposed to Lev. xi. 3; which only
defines them), the rest of the Deuteronomic version is much shorter
than that of Leviticus. Thus, except for <i>vv.</i> 4<i>b</i>, 5, the Deuteronomic
version, which in its general style, and to a certain extent in its phraseology
(cf. <span title="min">&#1502;&#1497;&#1503;</span> <i>kind</i>, <i>vv.</i> 13, 15, 18, and <span title="sheretz">&#1513;&#1512;&#1509;</span> <i>swarm</i>, <i>v.</i> 19), shows
traces of a priestly origin, might be regarded as an abridgment of
Lev. xi. But the Deuteronomic version uses <span title="tame">&#1496;&#1502;&#1488;</span> <i>unclean</i> throughout
(<i>vv.</i> 7, 10. 19), while Lev xi. from v. 11 onwards employs the technical
term <span title="sheketz">&#1513;&#1511;&#1509;</span> <i>detestable thing</i>, and it is at least equally possible to treat
the longer version of Leviticus as an expansion of Deut. xiv. 4-20.
The fact that Deut. xiv. 21 permits the stranger (<span title="gher">&#1490;&#1512;</span>) to eat the flesh
of any animal that dies a natural death, while Lev. xvii. 25 places
him on an equal footing with the Israelite, cannot be cited in favour
of the priority of Deuteronomy since <i>v.</i> 21 is clearly supplementary;
cf. also Lev. xi. 39. On the whole it seems best to accept the view
that both passages are derived separately from an earlier source.</p>

<p>2. Chap. xii. prescribes regulations for the purification of a
woman after the birth of (<i>a</i>) a male and (<i>b</i>) a female child. It has
been already pointed out that this chapter would follow more suitably
after chap. xv., with which it is closely allied in regard to subject-matter.
The closing formula (<i>v.</i> 7) shows clearly that, as in the case
of v. 7-13 (cf. i. 14-17), the concessions in favour of the poorer
worshipper are a later addition.</p>

<p>3. Chaps. xiii., xiv. The regulations concerning leprosy fall readily
into four main divisions: (<i>a</i>) xiii. 1-46<i>a</i>, an elaborate description
of the symptoms common to the earlier stages of leprosy and
other skin diseases to guide the priest in deciding as to the cleanness
or uncleanness of the patient; (<i>b</i>) xiii. 47-59, a further description
of different kinds of mould or fungus growth affecting stuffs and
leather; (<i>c</i>) xiv. 1-32, the rites of purification to be employed after
the healing of leprosy; and (<i>d</i>) xiv. 33-53, regulations dealing with
the appearance of patches of mould or mildew on the walls of a house.
Like other collections the group of laws on leprosy easily betrays
its composite character and exhibits unmistakable evidence of its
gradual growth. There is, however, no reason to doubt that a large
portion of the laws is genuinely old since the subject is one that would
naturally call for early legislation; moreover, Deut. xxiv. 8 presupposes
the existence of regulations concerning leprosy, presumably
oral, which were in the possession of the priests. The earliest sections
are admittedly xiii. 1-46<i>a</i> and xiv. 2-8<i>a</i>, the ritual of the latter being
obviously of a very archaic type. The secondary character of xiii.
47-59 is evident: it interrupts the close connexion between xiii.
1-46<i>a</i> and xiv. 2-8<i>a</i>, and further it is provided with its own colophon
in <i>v.</i> 59. A similar character must be assigned to the remaining
verses of chap. xiv., with the exception of the colophon in <i>v.</i> 57<i>b</i>;
the latter has been successively expanded in <i>vv.</i> 54-57<i>a</i> so as to
include the later additions. Thus xiv. 9-20 prescribes a second and
more elaborate ritual of purification after the healing of leprosy,
though the leper, according to <i>v.</i> 8<i>a</i>, is already clean; its secondary
character is further shown by the heightening of the ceremonial
which seems to be modelled on that of the consecration of the priest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page517" id="page517"></a>517</span>
(viii. 23 ff.), the multiplication of sacrifices and the minute regulations
with regard to the blood and oil. The succeeding section (<i>vv.</i> 21-32)
enjoins special modifications for those who cannot afford the more
costly offerings of <i>vv.</i> 9-20, and like v. 7-13, xii. 8 is clearly a later
addition; cf. the separate colophon, <i>v.</i> 32. The closing section xiv.
33-53 is closely allied to xiii. 47-59, though probably later in date:
probably the concluding verses (48-53), in which the same rites are
prescribed for the purification of a house as are ordained for a person
in <i>vv.</i> 3-8<i>a</i>, were added at a still later period.</p>

<p>4. Chap. xv. deals with the rites of purification rendered
necessary by various natural secretions, and is therefore closely
related to chap. xii. On the analogy of the other laws it is probable
that the old <i>t&#333;r&#257;h</i>, which forms the basis of the chapter, has been
subsequently expanded, but except in the colophon (<i>vv.</i> 32-34),
which displays marks of later redaction, there is nothing to guide
us in separating the additional matter.</p>

<p>Chap. xvi. It may be regarded as certain that this chapter
consists of three main elements, only one of which was originally
connected with the ceremonial of the Day of Atonement, and that
it has passed through more than one stage of revision. Since the
appearance of Benzinger&rsquo;s analysis <i>ZATW</i> (1889), critics in the main
have accepted the division of the chapter into three independent
sections: (1) <i>vv.</i> 1-4, 6, 12, 13, 34b (probably <i>vv.</i> 23, 24 also form
part of this section), regulations to be observed by Aaron whenever
he might enter &ldquo;the holy place within the veil.&rdquo; These regulations
are the natural outcome of the death of Nadab and Abihu (x. 1-5),
and their object is to guard Aaron from a similar fate; the section
thus forms the direct continuation of chap. x.; (2) <i>vv.</i> 29-34<i>a</i>,
rules for the observance of a yearly fast day, having for their object
the purification of the sanctuary and of the people; (3) <i>vv.</i> 5, 7-10,
14-22, 26-28, a later expansion of the blood-ritual to be performed
by the high-priest when he enters the Holy of Holies, with which is
combined the strange ceremony of the goat which is sent away
into the wilderness to Azazel. The matter common to the first two
sections, viz. the entrance of the high priest into the Holy of Holies,
was doubtless the cause of their subsequent fusion; beyond this,
however, the sections have no connexion with one another, and must
originally have been quite independent. Doubtless, as Benzinger
suggests, the rites to be performed by the officiating high priest on
the annual Day of Atonement, which are not prescribed in <i>vv.</i> 29-34<i>a</i>,
were identical with those laid down in chap. ix. That the third
section belongs to a later stage of development and was added at a
later date is shown by (<i>a</i>) the incongruity of <i>vv.</i> 14 ff. with <i>v.</i> 6&mdash;according
to the latter the purification of Aaron is a preliminary condition
of his entrance within the veil&mdash;and (<i>b</i>) the elaborate ceremonial
in connexion with the sprinkling of the blood. The first section,
doubtless, belongs to the main narrative of P; it connects directly
with chap. x. and presupposes only one altar (cf. <i>v.</i> 12, Exod. xxviii.
35). The second and third sections, however, must be assigned to a
later stratum of P, if only because they appear to have been unknown
to Ezra (Neh. ix. 1); the fact that Ezra&rsquo;s fast day took place on the
twenty-fourth day of the seventh month (as opposed to Lev. xvi.
29, xxiii. 26 f.) acquires an additional importance in view of the
agreement between Neh. viii. 23 f. and Lev. xxiii. 33 f. as to the date of
the Feast of Tabernacles. No mention is made of the Day of Atonement
in the pre-exilic period, and it is a plausible conjecture that the
present law arose from the desire to turn the spontaneous fasting of
Neh. ix. 1 into an annual ceremony; in any case directions as to the
annual performance of the rite must originally have preceded <i>vv.</i>
29 ff. Possibly the omission of this introduction is due to the redactor
who combined (1) and (2) by transferring the regulations of
(1) to the ritual of the annual Day of Atonement. At a later period
the ritual was further developed by the inclusion of the additional
ceremonial contained in (3).</p>
</div>

<p>III. <i>The Law of Holiness.</i>&mdash;Chaps. xvii.-xxvi. The group of
laws contained in these chapters has long been recognized as
standing apart from the rest of the legislation set forth in
Leviticus. For, though they display undeniable affinity with P,
they also exhibit certain features which closely distinguish them
from that document. The most noticeable of these is the prominence
assigned to certain leading ideas and motives, especially to
that of <i>holiness</i>. The idea of holiness, indeed, is so characteristic
of the entire group that the title &ldquo;Law of Holiness,&rdquo; first given
to it by Klostermann (1877), has been generally adopted. The
term &ldquo;holiness&rdquo; in this connexion consists positively in the
fulfilment of ceremonial obligations and negatively in abstaining
from the defilement caused by heathen customs and superstitions,
but it also includes obedience to the moral requirements of the
religion of Yahweh.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>On the literary side also the chapters are distinguished by the
paraenetic setting in which the laws are embedded and by the use
of a special terminology, many of the words and phrases occurring
rarely, if ever, in P (for a list of characteristic phrases cf. Driver,
<i>L.O.T.</i>^6, p. 49). Further, the structure of these chapters, which closely
resembles that of the other two Hexateuchal codes (Exod. xx. 22-xxiii.
and Deut. xii.-xxviii.), may reasonably be adduced in support of
their independent origin. All three codes contain a somewhat miscellaneous
collection of laws; all alike commence with regulations as
to the place of sacrifice and close with an exhortation. Lastly, some
of the laws treat of subjects which have been already dealt with
in P (cf. xvii. 10-14 and vii. 26 f., xix. 6-8 and vii. 15-18). It is
hardly doubtful also that the group of laws, which form the basis
of chaps. xvii.-xxvi., besides being independent of P, represent an
older stage of legislation than that code. For the sacrificial system
of H (= Law of Holiness) is less developed than that of P, and in
particular shows no knowledge of the sin- and trespass-offerings;
the high priest is only <i>primus inter pares</i> among his brethren, xxi. 10
(cf. Lev. x. 6, 7, where the same prohibition is extended to all the
priests); the distinction between &ldquo;holy&rdquo; and &ldquo;most holy&rdquo; things
(Num. xviii. 8) is unknown to Lev. xxii. (Lev. xxi. 22 is a later
addition). It cannot be denied, however, that chaps. xvii.-xxvi.
present many points of resemblance with P, both in language and
subject-matter, but on closer examination these points of contact
are seen to be easily separable from the main body of the legislation.
It is highly probable, therefore, that these marks of P are to be
assigned to the compiler who combined H with P. But though it
may be regarded as certain that H existed as an independent code,
it cannot be maintained that the laws which it contains are all of
the same origin or belong to the same age. The evidence rather
shows that they were first collected by an editor before they were
incorporated in P. Thus there is a marked difference in style between
the laws themselves and the paraenetic setting in which they are
embedded; and it is not unnatural to conjecture that this setting
is the work of the first editor.</p>

<p>Two other points in connexion with H are of considerable importance:
(<i>a</i>) the possibility of other remains of H, and (<i>b</i>) its relation to
Deuteronomy and Ezekiel.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) It is generally recognized that H, in its present form, is incomplete.
The original code must, it is felt, have included many
other subjects now passed over in silence. These, possibly, were
omitted by the compiler of P, because they had already been dealt
with elsewhere, or they may have been transferred to other connexions.
This latter possibility is one that has appealed to many
scholars, who have accordingly claimed many other passages of P as
parts of H. We have already accepted xi. 43 ff. as an undoubted
excerpt from H, but, with the exception of Num. xv. 37-41 (on
fringes), the other passages of the Hexateuch which have been attributed
to H do not furnish sufficient evidence to justify us in assigning
them to that collection. Moore (<i>Ency. Bibl.</i> col. 2787) rightly points
out that &ldquo;resemblance in the subject or formulation of laws to
<i>t&#333;r&#333;th</i> incorporated in H may point to a relation to the <i>sources</i>
of H, but is not evidence that these laws were ever included in that
collection.&rdquo;</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The exact relation of H to Deuteronomy and Ezekiel is hard
to determine. That chaps. xvii.-xxvi. display a marked affinity to
Deuteronomy cannot be denied. Like D, they lay great stress on the
duties of humanity and charity both to the Israelite and to the
stranger (Deut. xxiv.; Lev. xix.; compare also laws affecting the
poor in Deut. xv.; Lev. xxv.), but in some respects the legislation
of H appears to reflect a more advanced stage than that of D, <i>e.g.</i>
the rules for the priesthood (chap. xxi.), the feasts (xxiii. 9-20, 39-43),
the Sabbatical year (xxv. 1-7, 18-22), weights and measures (xix.
35 f.). It must be remembered, however, that these laws have
passed through more than one stage of revision and that the original
regulations have been much obscured by later glosses and additions;
it is therefore somewhat hazardous to base any argument on their
present form. &ldquo;The mutual independence of the two (codes) is
rather to be argued from the absence of laws identically formulated,
the lack of agreement in order either in the whole or in smaller
portions, and the fact that of the peculiar motives and phrases of
R<span class="su">D</span> there is no trace in H (Lev. xxiii. 40 is almost solitary). It is an
unwarranted assumption that all the fragments of Israelite legislation
which have been preserved lie in one serial development&rdquo;
(Moore, <i>Ency. Bibl.</i> col. 2790).</p>

<p>The relation of H to Ezekiel is remarkably close, the resemblances
between the two being so striking that many writers have regarded
Ezekiel as the author of H. Such a theory, however, is excluded
by the existence of even greater differences of style and matter,
so that the main problem to be decided is whether Ezekiel is prior to
H or vice versa. The main arguments brought forward by those
who maintain the priority of Ezekiel are (1) the fact that H makes
mention of a high priest, whereas Ezekiel betrays no knowledge
of such an official, and (2) that the author of Lev. xxvi. presupposes
a condition of exile and looks forward to a restoration from it.
Too much weight, however, must not be attached to these points;
for (1) the phrase used in Lev. xxi. 10 (<i>literally</i>, &ldquo;he who is greater
than his brethren&rdquo;) cannot be regarded as the equivalent of
the definitive &ldquo;chief priest&rdquo; of P, and is rather comparable with
the usage of 2 Kings xxii. 4 ff., xxv. 18 (&ldquo;the chief priest&rdquo;), cf. &ldquo;the
priest&rdquo; in xi. 9 ff., xvi. 10 ff.; and (2) the passages in Lev. xxvi.
(<i>vv.</i> 34 f., 39-45), which are especially cited in support of the exilic
standpoint of the writer, are just those which, on other grounds,
show signs of later interpolation. The following considerations undoubtedly
suggest the priority of H: (1) there is no trace in H of the
distinction between priests and Levites first introduced by Ezekiel;
(2) Ezekiel xviii., xx., xxii., xxiii. appear to presuppose the laws of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page518" id="page518"></a>518</span>
Lev. xviii.-xx.; (3) the calendar of Lev. xxiii. represents an earlier
stage of development than the fixed days and months of Ezek. xlv.;
(4) the sin- and trespass-offerings are not mentioned in H (cf. Ezek.
xl. 39, xlii. 13, xliv. 29, xlvi. 20); (5) the parallels to H, which are
found especially in Ezek. xviii., xx., xxii. f., include both the paraenetic
setting and the laws; and lastly, (6) a comparison of Lev. xxvi.
with Ezekiel points to the greater originality of the former. Baentsch,
however, who is followed by Bertholet, adopts the view that Lev.
xxvi. is rather an independent hortatory discourse modelled on
Ezekiel. The same writer further maintains that H consists of three
separate elements, viz. chaps. xvii.; xviii.-xx., with various ordinances
in chaps. xxiii.-xxv.; and xxii., xxiii., of which the last is certainly
later than Ezekiel, while the second is in the main prior to that
author. But the arguments which he adduces in favour of the
threefold origin of H are not sufficient to outweigh the general
impression of unity which the code presents.</p>

<p>Chap. xvii. comprises four main sections which are clearly
marked off by similar introductory and closing formulae: (1) <i>vv.</i>
3-7, prohibition of the slaughter of domestic animals, unless they are
presented to Yahweh; (2) <i>vv.</i> 8, 9, sacrifices to be offered to Yahweh
alone; (3) <i>vv.</i> 10-12, prohibition of the eating of blood; (4) <i>vv.</i> 13,
14, the blood of animals not used in sacrifice to be poured on the
ground. The chapter as a whole is to be assigned to H. At the
same time it exhibits many marks of affinity with P, a phenomenon
most easily explained by the supposition that older laws of H have
been expanded and modified by later hands in the spirit of P. Clear
instances of such revision may be seen in the references to &ldquo;the
door of the tent of meeting&rdquo; (<i>vv.</i> 4, 5, 6, 9) and &ldquo;the camp&rdquo; (<i>v.</i> 3),
as well as in <i>vv.</i> 6, 11, 12-14; <i>vv.</i> 15, 16 (prohibiting the eating of
animals that die a natural death or are torn by beasts) differ formally
from the preceding paragraphs, and are to be assigned to P. What
remains after the excision of later additions, however, is not entirely
uniform, and points to earlier editorial work on the part of the
compiler of H. Thus <i>vv.</i> 3-7 reflect two points of view, <i>vv.</i> 3, 4
drawing a contrast between profane slaughter and sacrifice, while
<i>vv.</i> 5-7 distinguish between sacrifices offered to Yahweh and those
offered to demons.</p>

<p>Chap. xviii. contains laws on prohibited marriages (<i>vv.</i> 6-18)
and various acts of unchastity (<i>vv.</i> 19-23) embedded in a paraenetic
setting (<i>vv.</i> 1-5 and 24-30), the laws being given in the 2nd pers.
sing., while the framework employs the 2nd pers. plural. With the
exception of <i>v.</i> 21 (on Molech worship), which is here out of place,
and has possibly been introduced from xx. 2-5, the chapter displays
all the characteristics of H.</p>

<p>Chap. xix. is a collection of miscellaneous laws, partly moral,
partly religious, of which the fundamental principle is stated in <i>v.</i> 2
(&ldquo;Ye shall be holy&rdquo;). The various laws are clearly defined by the
formula &ldquo;I am Yahweh,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am Yahweh your God,&rdquo; phrases
which are especially characteristic of chaps. xviii.-xx. The first
group of laws (<i>vv.</i> 3 f.) corresponds to the first table of the decalogue,
while <i>vv.</i> 11-18 are analogous to the second table; <i>vv.</i> 5-8 (on
peace-offerings) are obviously out of place here, and are possibly
to be restored to the cognate passage xxii. 29 f., while the humanitarian
provisions of <i>vv.</i> 9 and 10 (cf. xxiii. 22) have no connexion
with the immediate context; similarly <i>v.</i> 20 (to which a later
redactor has added <i>vv.</i> 21, 22, in accordance with vi. 6 f.) appears
to be a fragment from a penal code; the passage resembles Exod.
xxi. 7 ff., and the offence is clearly one against property, the omission
of the punishment being possibly due to the redactor who added
<i>vv.</i> 21, 22.</p>

<p>Chap. xx. Prohibitions against Molech worship, <i>vv.</i> 2-5, witchcraft,
<i>vv.</i> 6 and 27, unlawful marriages and acts of unchastity, <i>vv.</i>
10-21. Like chap. xviii., the main body of laws is provided with a
paraenetic setting, <i>vv.</i> 7, 8 and 22-24; it differs from that chapter,
however, in prescribing the death penalty in each case for disobedience.
Owing to the close resemblance between the two chapters,
many critics have assumed that they are derived from the same
source and that the latter chapter was added for the purpose of
supplying the penalties. This view, however, is not borne out by
a comparison of the two chapters, for four of the cases mentioned
in chap. xviii. (<i>vv.</i> 7, 10, 17<i>b</i>, 18) are ignored in chap. xx., while the
order and in part the terminology are also different; further, it is
difficult on this view to explain why the two chapters are separated
by chap. xix. A more probable explanation is that the compiler
of H has drawn from two parallel, but independent, sources. Signs
of revision are not lacking, especially in <i>vv.</i> 2-5, where <i>vv.</i> 4 f. are a
later addition intended to reconcile the inconsistency of <i>v.</i> 2 with
<i>v.</i> 3 (R<span class="su">H</span>); <i>v.</i> 6, which is closely connected with xix. 31, appears to
be less original than v. 27, and may be ascribed to the same hand
as <i>v.</i> 3; <i>v.</i> 9 can hardly be in its original context&mdash;it would be more
suitable after xxiv. 15. The paraenetic setting (<i>vv.</i> 7, 8 and 22-24)
is to be assigned to the compiler of H, who doubtless prefaced the
parallel version with the additional laws of <i>vv.</i> 2-6. Verses 25, 26
apparently formed the conclusion of a law on clean and unclean
animals similar to that of chap. xi., and very probably mark the place
where H&rsquo;s regulations on that subject originally stood.</p>

<p>Chaps. xxi., xxii. A series of laws affecting the priests and offerings,
viz. (1) regulations ensuring the holiness of (<i>a</i>) ordinary
priests, xxi. 1-9, and (<i>b</i>) the chief priest, <i>vv.</i> 10-15; (2) a list of
physical defects which exclude a priest from exercising his office,
<i>vv.</i> 16-24; (3) the enjoyment of sacred offerings limited to (<i>a</i>)
priests, if they are ceremonially clean, xxi. 1-9, and (<i>b</i>) members
of a priestly family, <i>vv.</i> 10-16; (4) animals offered in sacrifice must
be without blemish, <i>vv.</i> 17-25; (5) further regulations with regard
to sacrifices, <i>vv.</i> 26-30, with a paraenetic conclusion, <i>vv.</i> 31-33.</p>

<p>These chapters present considerable difficulty to the literary critic;
for while they clearly illustrate the application of the principle of
&ldquo;holiness,&rdquo; and in the main exhibit the characteristic phraseology
of H, they also display many striking points of contact with P and
the later strata of P, which have been closely interwoven into the
original laws. These phenomena can be best explained by the
supposition that we have here a body of old laws which have been
subjected to more than one revision. The nature of the subjects
with which they deal is one that naturally appealed to the priestly
schools, and owing to this fact the laws were especially liable to
modification and expansion at the hands of later legislators who
wished to bring them into conformity with later usage. Signs of
such revision may be traced back to the compiler of H, but the
evidence shows that the process must have been continued down to
the latest period of editorial activity in connexion with P. To redactors
of the school of P belong such phrases as &ldquo;the sons of Aaron&rdquo; (xxi.
1, 24, xxii. 2, 18), &ldquo;the seed of Aaron&rdquo; (xxi. 21, xxii. 4 and &ldquo;thy
seed,&rdquo; <i>v.</i> 17; cf. xxii. 3), &ldquo;the offerings of the Lord made by fire&rdquo;
(xxi. 6, 21, xxii. 22, 27), &ldquo;the most holy things&rdquo; (xxi. 22; cf. xxii.
3 ff. &ldquo;holy things&rdquo; only), &ldquo;throughout their (or your) generations&rdquo;
(xxi. 7, xxii. 3), the references to the anointing of Aaron (xxi. 10, 12)
and the Veil (xxi. 23), the introductory formulae (xxi. 1, 16 f., xxii.
1 f., 17 f., 26) and the subscription (xxi. 24). Apart from these
redactional additions, chap. xxi. is to be ascribed to H, <i>vv.</i> 6 and 8
being possibly the work of R<span class="su">H</span>. Most critics detect a stronger
influence of P in chap. xxii., more especially in <i>vv.</i> 3-7 and 17-25,
29, 30; most probably these verses have been largely recast and
expanded by later editors, but it is noticeable that they contain no
mention of either sin- or trespass-offerings.</p>

<p>Chap. xxiii. A calendar of sacred seasons. The chapter consists
of two main elements which can easily be distinguished from one
another, the one being derived from P and the other from H. To
the former belongs the fuller and more elaborate description of <i>vv.</i>
4-8, 21, 23-38; to the latter, <i>vv.</i> 9-20, 22, 39-44. Characteristic of
the priestly calendar are (1) the enumeration of &ldquo;holy convocations,&rdquo;
(2) the prohibition of all work, (3) the careful determination of the
date by the day and month, (4) the mention of &ldquo;the offerings made
by fire to Yahweh,&rdquo; and (5) the stereotyped form of the regulations.
The older calendar, on the other hand, knows nothing of &ldquo;holy
convocations,&rdquo; nor of abstinence from work; the time of the
feasts, which are clearly connected with agriculture, is only roughly
defined with reference to the harvest (cf. Exod. xxiii. 14 ff., xxxiv.
22; Deut. xvi. 9 ff.).</p>

<p>The calendar of P comprises (<i>a</i>) the Feast of Passover and the
Unleavened Cakes, <i>vv.</i> 4-8; (<i>b</i>) a fragment of Pentecost, v. 21;
(<i>c</i>) the Feast of Trumpets, <i>vv.</i> 23-25; (<i>d</i>) the Day of Atonement,
<i>vv.</i> 26-32; and (<i>e</i>) the Feast of Tabernacles, <i>vv.</i> 33-36, with a subscription
in <i>vv.</i> 37, 38. With these have been incorporated the older
regulations of H on the Feast of Weeks, or Pentecost, <i>vv.</i> 9-20,
which have been retained in place of P&rsquo;s account (cf. <i>v.</i> 21), and on
the Feast of Tabernacles, <i>vv.</i> 39-44, the latter being clearly intended
to supplement <i>vv.</i> 33-36. The hand of the redactor who combined
the two elements may be seen partly in additions designed to accommodate
the regulations of H to P (<i>e.g.</i> <i>v.</i> 39<i>a</i>, &ldquo;on the fifteenth day
of the seventh month,&rdquo; and 39<i>b</i>, &ldquo;and on the eighth day shall be
a solemn rest&rdquo;), partly in the later expansions corresponding to
later usage, <i>vv.</i> 12 f., 18, 19<i>a</i>, 21<i>b</i>, 41. Further, <i>vv.</i> 26-32 (on the
Day of Atonement, cf. xvi.) are a later addition to the P sections.</p>

<p>Chap. xxiv. affords an interesting illustration of the manner in
which the redactor of P has added later elements to the original code
of H. For the first part of the chapter, with its regulations as to
(<i>a</i>) the lamps in the Tabernacle, <i>vv.</i> 1-4, and (<i>b</i>) the Shewbread, <i>vv.</i>
5-9, is admittedly derived from P, <i>vv.</i> 1-4, forming a supplement
to Exod. xxv. 31-40 (cf. xxvii. 20 f.) and Num. viii. 1-4, and <i>vv.</i> 5-9
to Exod. xxv. 30. The rest of the chapter contains old laws (<i>vv.</i>
15<i>b</i>-22) derived from H on blasphemy, manslaughter and injuries
to the person, to which the redactor has added an historical setting
(<i>vv.</i> 10-14, 23) as well as a few glosses.</p>

<p>Chap. xxv. lays down regulations for the observance of (<i>a</i>) the
Sabbatical year, <i>vv.</i> 1-7, 19-22, and (<i>b</i>) the year of Jubilees, <i>vv.</i> 8-18,
23, and then applies the principle of redemption to (1) land and house
property, <i>vv.</i> 24-34, and (2) persons, <i>vv.</i> 35-55. The rules for the
Sabbatical year (<i>vv.</i> 1-7) are admittedly derived from H, and <i>vv.</i>
19-22 are also from the same source. Their present position after
<i>vv.</i> 8-18 is due to the redactor who wished to apply the same rules
to the year of Jubilee. But though the former of the two sections
on the year of Jubilee (<i>vv.</i> 8-18, 23) exhibits undoubted signs of P,
the traces of H are also sufficiently marked to warrant the conclusion
that the latter code included laws relating to the year of Jubilee,
and that these have been modified by R<span class="su">P</span> and then connected with
the regulations for the Sabbatical year. Signs of the redactor&rsquo;s
handiwork may be seen in <i>vv.</i> 9, 11-13 (the year of Jubilee treated
as a fallow year) and 15, 16 (cf. the repetition of &ldquo;ye shall not wrong
one another,&rdquo; <i>vv.</i> 14 and 17). Both on historical and on critical
grounds, however, it is improbable that the principle of restitution
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page519" id="page519"></a>519</span>
underlying the regulations for the year of Jubilee was originally
extended to <i>persons</i> in the earlier code. For it is difficult to
harmonize the laws as to the release of Hebrew slaves with the other
legislation on the same subject (Exod. xxi. 2-6; Deut. xv.), while
both the secondary position which they occupy in this chapter and
their more elaborate and formal character point to a later origin
for <i>vv.</i> 35-55. Hence these verses in the main must be assigned to R<span class="su">P</span>.
In this connexion it is noticeable that <i>vv.</i> 35-38, 39-40<i>a</i>, 43, 47,
53, 55, which show the characteristic marks of H, bear no special
relation to the year of Jubilee, but merely inculcate a more humane
treatment of those Israelites who are compelled by circumstances to
sell themselves either to their brethren or to strangers. It is
probable, therefore, that they form no part of the original
legislation of the year of Jubilee, but were incorporated at a later
period. The present form of <i>vv.</i> 24-34 is largely due to R<span class="su">P</span>, who
has certainly added <i>vv.</i> 32-34 (cities of the Levites) and probably
<i>vv.</i> 29-31.</p>

<p>Chap. xxvi. The concluding exhortation. After reiterating commands
to abstain from idolatry and to observe the Sabbath, <i>vv.</i> 1, 2, the
chapter sets forth (<i>a</i>) the rewards of obedience, <i>vv.</i> 3-13, and (<i>b</i>)
the penalties incurred by disobedience to the preceding laws, <i>vv.</i>
14-46. The discourse, which is spoken throughout in the name of
Yahweh, is similar in character to Exod. xxiii. 20-33 and Deut.
xxviii., more especially to the latter. That it forms an integral
part of H is shown both by the recurrence of the same distinctive
phraseology and by the emphasis laid on the same motives. At the
same time it is hardly doubtful that the original discourse has been
modified and expanded by later hands, especially in the concluding
paragraphs. Thus <i>vv.</i> 34, 35, which refer back to xxv. 2 ff.,
interrupt the connexion and must be assigned to the priestly
redactor, while <i>vv.</i> 40-45 display obvious signs of interpolation.
With regard to the literary relation of this chapter with Ezekiel,
it must be admitted that Ezekiel presents many striking parallels,
and in particular makes use, in common with chap. xxvi., of several
expressions which do not occur elsewhere in the Old Testament. But
there are also points of difference both as regards phraseology and
subject-matter, and in view of these latter it is impossible to hold
that Ezekiel was either the author or compiler of this chapter.</p>

<p>Chap. xxvii. On the commutation of vows and tithes. The chapter as a
whole must be assigned to a later stratum of P, for while <i>vv.</i> 2-25
(on vows) presuppose the year of Jubilee, the section on tithes, <i>vv.</i>
30-33, marks a later stage of development than Num. xviii. 21 ff.
(P); <i>vv.</i> 26-29 (on firstlings and devoted things) are supplementary
restrictions to <i>vv.</i> 2-25.</p>

was educated at Newnham College, Cambridge. She showed a precocious
aptitude for writing verse of exceptional merit, and in 1884 she
published a volume of poems, <i>A Minor Poet and Other Verse</i>, some of
the pieces in which had already been printed at Cambridge with the
title <i>Xantippe and Other Poems</i>. The high level of this first
publication was maintained in <i>A London Plane Tree and Other Poems</i>, a
collection of lyrics published in 1889, in which the prevailing
pessimism of the writer&rsquo;s temperament was conspicuous. She had
already in 1888 tried her hand at prose fiction in <i>The Romance of a

extinct volcanoes of Central France, gneisses, and the origin of crystalline schists.
He wrote <i>Structures et classification des roches éruptives</i> (1889),

Together they wrote on the artificial production of felspar,
nepheline and other minerals, and also of meteorites, and produced

<p><span class="bold">LEWALD, FANNY<a name="ar39" id="ar39"></a></span> (1811-1889), German author, was born at
Königsberg in East Prussia on the 24th of March 1811, of Jewish
parentage. When seventeen years of age she embraced Christianity,
and after travelling in Germany, France and Italy, settled
in 1845 at Berlin. Here, in 1854, she married the author, Adolf
Wilhelm Theodor Stahr (1805-1876), and removed after his death
in 1876 to Dresden, where she resided, engaged in literary
work, until her death on the 5th of August 1889. Fanny Lewald
is less remarkable for her writings, which are mostly sober,
matter-of-fact works, though displaying considerable talent and
culture, than for her championship of &ldquo;women&rsquo;s rights,&rdquo; a
question which she was practically the first German woman to
take up, and for her scathing satire on the sentimentalism of
the Gräfin Hahn Hahn. This authoress she ruthlessly attacked
in the exquisite parody (<i>Diogena, Roman von Iduna Gräfin
H.... H....</i> (2nd ed., 1847). Among the best known of
her novels are <i>Klementine</i> (1842); <i>Prinz Louis Ferdinand</i>
(1849; 2nd ed., 1859); <i>Das Mädchen von Hela</i> (1860); <i>Von
Geschlecht zu Geschlecht</i> (8 vols., 1863-1865); <i>Benvenuto</i> (1875),
and <i>Stella</i> (1883; English by B. Marshall, 1884). Of her writings
in defence of the emancipation of women <i>Osterbriefe für die
Frauen</i> (1863) and <i>Für und wider die Frauen</i> (1870) are conspicuous.
Her autobiography, <i>Meine Lebensgeschichte</i> (6 vols.,
1861-1862), is brightly written and affords interesting glimpses
of the literary life of her time.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEWANIKA<a name="ar40" id="ar40"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 1860-&emsp;&emsp;), paramount chief of the Barotse
and subject tribes occupying the greater part of the upper
Zambezi basin, was the twenty-second of a long line of rulers,
whose founder invaded the Barotse valley about the beginning
of the 17th century, and according to tradition was the son of
a woman named Buya Mamboa by a god. The graves of
successive ruling chiefs are to this day respected and objects
of pilgrimage for purposes of ancestor worship. Lewanika
was born on the upper Kabompo in troublous times, where
his father&mdash;Letia, a son of a former ruler&mdash;lived in exile during
the interregnum of a foreign dynasty (Makololo), which remained
in possession from about 1830 to 1865, when the Makololo were
practically exterminated in a night by a well-organized revolt.
Once more masters of their own country, the Barotse invited
Sepopa, an uncle of Lewanika, to rule over them. Eleven years
of brutality and licence resulted in the tyrant&rsquo;s expulsion and
subsequent assassination, his place being taken by Ngwana-Wina,
a nephew. Within a year abuse of power brought about this
chief&rsquo;s downfall (1877), and he was succeeded by Lobosi, who
assumed the name of Lewanika in 1885. The early years of his
reign were also stained by many acts of blood, until in 1884
the torture and murder of his own brother led to open rebellion,
and it was only through extreme presence of mind that the
chief escaped with his life into exile. His cousin, Akufuna or
Tatela, was then proclaimed chief. It was during his brief
reign that François Coillard, the eminent missionary, arrived
at Lialui, the capital. The following year Lewanika, having
collected his partisans, deposed the usurper and re-established
his power. Ruthless revenge not unmixed with treachery
characterized his return to power, but gradually the strong
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page520" id="page520"></a>520</span>
personality of the high-minded François Coillard so far influenced
him for good that from about 1887 onward he ruled tolerantly
and showed a consistent desire to better the condition of his
people. In 1890 Lewanika, who two years previously had
proposed to place himself under the protection of Great Britain,
concluded a treaty with the British South Africa Company,
acknowledging its supremacy and conceding to it certain mineral
rights. In 1897 Mr R. T. Coryndon took up his position at
Lialui as British agent, and the country to the east of 25° E.
was thrown open to settlers, that to the west being reserved
to the Barotse chief. In 1905 the king of Italy&rsquo;s award in the
Barotse boundary dispute with Portugal deprived Lewanika
of half of his dominions, much of which had been ruled by his
ancestors for many generations. In 1902 Lewanika attended
the coronation of Edward VII. as a guest of the nation. His
recognized heir was his eldest son Letia.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEWES, CHARLES LEE<a name="ar41" id="ar41"></a></span> (1740-1803), English actor, was the
son of a hosier in London. After attending a school at Ambleside
he returned to London, where he found employment as a postman;
but about 1760 he went on the stage in the provinces, and some
three years later began to appear in minor parts at Covent
Garden Theatre. His first rôle of importance was that of
&ldquo;Young Marlow&rdquo; in <i>She Stoops to Conquer</i>, at its production
of that comedy in 1773, when he delivered an epilogue specially
written for him by Goldsmith. He remained a member of the
Covent Garden company till 1783, appearing in many parts,
among which were &ldquo;Fag&rdquo; in <i>The Rivals</i>, which he &ldquo;created,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Sir Anthony Absolute&rdquo; in the same comedy. In 1783 he
removed to Drury Lane, where he assumed the Shakespearian
rôles of &ldquo;Touchstone,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lucio&rdquo; and &ldquo;Falstaff.&rdquo; In 1787
he left London for Edinburgh, where he gave recitations, including
Cowper&rsquo;s &ldquo;John Gilpin.&rdquo; For a short time in 1792 Lewes
assisted Stephen Kemble in the management of the Dundee
Theatre; in the following year he went to Dublin, but he was
financially unsuccessful and suffered imprisonment for debt.
He employed his time in compiling his <i>Memoirs</i>, a worthless
production published after his death by his son. He was also
the author of some poor dramatic sketches. Lewes died on the
23rd of July 1803. He was three times married; the philosopher,
George Henry Lewes, was his grandson.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEWES, GEORGE HENRY<a name="ar42" id="ar42"></a></span> (1817-1878), British philosopher
and literary critic, was born in London in 1817. He was a
grandson of Charles Lee Lewes, the actor. He was educated
in London, Jersey, Brittany, and finally at Dr Burney&rsquo;s school
in Greenwich. Having abandoned successively a commercial
and a medical career, he seriously thought of becoming an actor,
and between 1841 and 1850 appeared several times on the stage.
Finally he devoted himself to literature, science and philosophy.
As early as 1836 he belonged to a club formed for the study of
philosophy, and had sketched out a physiological treatment of
the philosophy of the Scottish school. Two years later he went
to Germany, probably with the intention of studying philosophy.
In 1840 he married a daughter of Swynfen Stevens Jervis
(1798-1867), and during the next ten years supported himself
by contributing to the quarterly and other reviews. These
articles discuss a wide variety of subject, and, though often
characterized by hasty impulse and imperfect study, betray
a singularly acute critical judgment, enlightened by philosophic
study. The most valuable are those on the drama, afterwards
republished under the title <i>Actors and Acting</i> (1875). With
this may be taken the volume on <i>The Spanish Drama</i> (1846).
The combination of wide scholarship, philosophic culture and
practical acquaintance with the theatre gives these essays a
high place among the best efforts in English dramatic criticism.
In 1845-1846 he published <i>The Biographical History of Philosophy</i>,
an attempt to depict the life of philosophers as an ever-renewed
fruitless labour to attain the unattainable. In 1847-1848 he
made two attempts in the field of fiction&mdash;<i>Ranthrope</i>, and <i>Rose,
Blanche and Violet</i>&mdash;which, though displaying considerable
skill both in plot, construction and in characterization, have
taken no permanent place in literature. The same is to be
said of an ingenious attempt to rehabilitate Robespierre (1849).
In 1850 he collaborated with Thornton Leigh Hunt in the
foundation of the <i>Leader</i>, of which he was the literary editor.
In 1853 he republished under the title of <i>Comte&rsquo;s Philosophy
of the Sciences</i> a series of papers which had appeared in that
journal. In 1851 he became acquainted with Miss Evans
(George Eliot) and in 1854 left his wife. Subsequently he lived
with Miss Evans as her husband (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Eliot, George</a></span>).</p>

<p>The culmination of Lewes&rsquo;s work in prose literature is the
<i>Life of Goethe</i> (1855), probably the best known of his writings.
Lewes&rsquo;s many-sidedness of mind, and his combination of scientific
with literary tastes, eminently fitted him to appreciate the
large nature and the wide-ranging activity of the German
poet. The high position this work has taken in Germany itself,
notwithstanding the boldness of its criticism and the unpopularity
of some of its views (<i>e.g.</i> on the relation of the second to
the first part of <i>Faust</i>), is a sufficient testimony to its general
excellence. From about 1853 Lewes&rsquo;s writings show that he was
occupying himself with scientific and more particularly biological
work. He may be said to have always manifested a distinctly
scientific bent in his writings, and his closer devotion to science
was but the following out of early impulses. Considering that
he had not had the usual course of technical training, these
studies are a remarkable testimony to the penetration of his
intellect. The most important of these essays are collected in
the volumes <i>Seaside Studies</i> (1858), <i>Physiology of Common Life</i>
(1859), <i>Studies in Animal Life</i> (1862), and <i>Aristotle, a Chapter
from the History of Science</i> (1864). They are much more than
popular expositions of accepted scientific truths. They contain
able criticisms of authorized ideas, and embody the results of individual
research and individual reflection. He made a number
of impressive suggestions, some of which have since been accepted
by physiologists. Of these the most valuable is that now known
as the doctrine of the functional indifference of the nerves&mdash;that
what are known as the specific energies of the optic, auditory
and other nerves are simply differences in their mode of action
due to the differences of the peripheral structures or sense-organs
with which they are connected. This idea was subsequently
arrived at independently by Wundt (<i>Physiologische Psychologie</i>,
2nd ed., p. 321). In 1865, on the starting of the <i>Fortnightly
Review</i>, Lewes became its editor, but he retained the post for
less than two years, when he was succeeded by John Morley.
This date marks the transition from more strictly scientific
to philosophic work. He had from early youth cherished a
strong liking for philosophic studies; one of his earliest essays
was an appreciative account of Hegel&rsquo;s <i>Aesthetics</i>. Coming under
the influence of positivism as unfolded both in Comte&rsquo;s own works
and in J. S. Mill&rsquo;s <i>System of Logic</i>, he abandoned all faith in the
possibility of metaphysic, and recorded this abandonment in
the above-mentioned <i>History of Philosophy</i>. Yet he did not at
any time give an unqualified adhesion to Comte&rsquo;s teachings,
and with wider reading and reflection his mind moved away
further from the positivist standpoint. In the preface to the
third edition of his <i>History of Philosophy</i> he avowed a change
in this direction, and this movement is still more plainly discernible
in subsequent editions of the work. The final outcome
of this intellectual progress is given to us in <i>The Problems of
Life and Mind</i>, which may be regarded as the crowning work
of his life. His sudden death on the 28th of November 1878
cut short the work, yet it is complete enough to allow us to judge
of the author&rsquo;s matured conceptions on biological, psychological
and metaphysical problems. Of his three sons only one, Charles
(1843-1891), survived him; in the first London County Council
Election (1888) he was elected for St Pancras; he was also much
interested in the Hampstead Heath extension.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Philosophy.</i>&mdash;The first two volumes on <i>The Foundations of a Creed</i>
lay down what Lewes regarded as the true principles of philosophizing.
He here seeks to effect a <i>rapprochement</i> between metaphysic and
science. He is still so far a positivist as to pronounce all inquiry into
the ultimate nature of things fruitless. What matter, form, spirit are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page521" id="page521"></a>521</span>
in themselves is a futile question that belongs to the sterile region
of &ldquo;metempirics.&rdquo; But philosophical questions may be so stated
as to be susceptible of a precise solution by scientific method. Thus,
since the relation of subject to object falls within our experience,
it is a proper matter for philosophic investigation. It may be
questioned whether Lewes is right in thus identifying the methods of
science and philosophy. Philosophy is not a mere extension of
scientific knowledge; it is an investigation of the nature and validity
of the knowing process itself. In any case Lewes cannot be said to
have done much to aid in the settlement of properly philosophical
questions. His whole treatment of the question of the relation of
subject to object is vitiated by a confusion between the scientific
truth that mind and body coexist in the living organism and the
philosophic truth that all knowledge of objects implies a knowing
subject. In other words, to use Shadworth Hodgson&rsquo;s phrase, he
mixes up the question of the <i>genesis</i> of mental forms with the question
of their <i>nature</i> (see <i>Philosophy of Reflexion</i>, ii. 40-58). Thus he
reaches the &ldquo;monistic&rdquo; doctrine that mind and matter are two
aspects of the same existence by attending simply to the parallelism
between psychical and physical processes given as a fact (or a probable
fact) of our experience, and by leaving out of account their
relation as subject and object in the cognitive act. His identification
of the two as phases of one existence is open to criticism, not only
from the point of view of philosophy, but from that of science. In
his treatment of such ideas as &ldquo;sensibility,&rdquo; &ldquo;sentience&rdquo; and the
like, he does not always show whether he is speaking of physical or
of psychical phenomena. Among the other properly philosophic
questions discussed in these two volumes the nature of the casual
relation is perhaps the one which is handled with most freshness and
suggestiveness. The third volume, <i>The Physical Basis of Mind</i>,
further develops the writer&rsquo;s views on organic activities as a whole.
He insists strongly on the radical distinction between organic and
inorganic processes, and on the impossibility of ever explaining the
former by purely mechanical principles. With respect to the nervous
system, he holds that all its parts have one and the same elementary
property, namely, sensibility. Thus sensibility belongs as much to
the lower centres of the spinal cord as to the brain, contributing in
this more elementary form elements to the &ldquo;subconscious&rdquo; region
of mental life. The higher functions of the nervous system, which
make up our conscious mental life, are merely more complex modifications
of this fundamental property of nerve substance. Closely
related to this doctrine is the view that the nervous organism acts
as a whole, that particular mental operations cannot be referred to
definitely circumscribed regions of the brain, and that the hypothesis
of nervous activity passing in the centre by an isolated pathway
from one nerve-cell to another is altogether illusory. By insisting
on the complete coincidence between the regions of nerve-action and
sentience, and by holding that these are but different aspects of one
thing, he is able to attack the doctrine of animal and human automatism,
which affirms that feeling or consciousness is merely an
incidental concomitant of nerve-action and in no way essential to the
chain of physical events. Lewes&rsquo;s views in psychology, partly opened
up in the earlier volumes of the <i>Problems</i>, are more fully worked out
in the last two volumes (3rd series). He discusses the method of
psychology with much insight. He claims against Comte and his
followers a place for introspection in psychological research. In
addition to this subjective method there must be an objective, which
consists partly in a reference to nervous conditions and partly in the
employment of sociological and historical data. Biological knowledge,
or a consideration of the organic conditions, would only help
us to explain mental <i>functions</i>, as feeling and thinking; it would
not assist us to understand differences of mental <i>faculty</i> as manifested
in different races and stages of human development. The
organic conditions of these differences will probably for ever escape
detection. Hence they can be explained only as the products of the
social environment. This idea of dealing with mental phenomena in
their relation to social and historical conditions is probably Lewes&rsquo;s
most important contribution to psychology. Among other points
which he emphasizes is the complexity of mental phenomena. Every
mental state is regarded as compounded of three factors in different
proportions&mdash;namely, a process of sensible affection, of logical
grouping and of motor impulse. But Lewes&rsquo;s work in psychology
consists less in any definite discoveries than in the inculcation of a
sound and just method. His biological training prepared him to
view mind as a complex unity, in which the various functions
interact one on the other, and of which the highest processes are
identical with and evolved out of the lower. Thus the operations of
thought, &ldquo;or the logic of signs,&rdquo; are merely a more complicated
form of the elementary operations of sensation and instinct or &ldquo;the
logic of feeling.&rdquo; The whole of the last volume of the <i>Problems</i> may
be said to be an illustration of this position. It is a valuable
repository of psychological facts, many of them drawn from the more
obscure regions of mental life and from abnormal experience, and
is throughout suggestive and stimulating. To suggest and to
stimulate the mind, rather than to supply it with any complete
system of knowledge, may be said to be Lewes&rsquo;s service in philosophy.
The exceptional rapidity and versatility of his intelligence seems to
account at once for the freshness in his way of envisaging the subject-matter
of philosophy and psychology, and for the want of satisfactory
elaboration and of systematic co-ordination.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEWES,<a name="ar43" id="ar43"></a></span> a market-town and municipal borough and the
county town of Sussex, England, in the Lewes parliamentary
division, 50 m. S. from London by the London, Brighton &amp;
South Coast railway. Pop. (1901) 11,249. It is picturesquely
situated on the slope of a chalk down falling to the river Ouse.
Ruins of the old castle, supposed to have been founded by King
Alfred and rebuilt by William de Warenne shortly after the
Conquest, rise from the height. There are two mounds which
bore keeps, an uncommon feature. The castle guarded the pass
through the downs formed by the valley of the Ouse. In one of
the towers is the collection of the Sussex Archaeological Society.
St Michael&rsquo;s church is without architectural merit, but contains
old brasses and monuments; St Anne&rsquo;s church is a transitional
Norman structure; St Thomas-at-Cliffe is Perpendicular; St
John&rsquo;s, Southover, of mixed architecture, preserves some early
Norman portions, and has some relics of the Warenne family.
In the grounds of the Cluniac priory of St Pancras, founded in
1078, the leaden coffins of William de Warenne and Gundrada
his wife were dug up during an excavation for the railway in 1845.
There is a free grammar school dating from 1512, and among the
other public buildings are the town hall and corn exchange,
county hall, prison, and the Fitzroy memorial library. The
industries include the manufacture of agricultural implements,
brewing, tanning, and iron and brass founding. The municipal
borough is under a mayor, 6 aldermen and 18 councillors. Area,
1042 acres.</p>

<p>The many neolithic and bronze implements that have been
discovered, and the numerous tumuli and earthworks which
surround Lewes, indicate its remote origin. The town Lewes
(Loewas, Loewen, Leswa, Laquis, Latisaquensis) was in the royal
demesne of the Saxon kings, from whom it received the privilege
of a market. Æthelstan established two royal mints there, and
by the reign of Edward the Confessor, and probably before, Lewes
was certainly a borough. William I. granted the whole barony
of Lewes, including the revenue arising from the town, to
William de Warenne, who converted an already existing fortification
into a place of residence. His descendants continued to hold
the barony until the beginning of the 14th century. In default
of male issue, it then passed to the earl of Arundel, with whose
descendants it remained until 1439, when it was divided between
the Norfolks, Dorsets and Abergavennys. By 1086 the borough
had increased 30% in value since the beginning of the reign,
and its importance as a port and market-town is evident from
Domesday. A gild merchant seems to have existed at an
early date. The first mention of it is in a charter of Reginald de
Warenne, about 1148, by which he restored to the burgesses the
privileges they had enjoyed in the time of his grandfather and
father, but of which they had been deprived. In 1595 a &ldquo;Fellowship&rdquo;
took the place of the old gild and in conjunction with
two constables governed the town until the beginning of the 18th
century. The borough seal probably dates from the 14th
century. Lewes was incorporated by royal charter in 1881.
The town returned two representatives to parliament from 1295
until deprived of one member in 1867. It was disfranchised in
1885. Earl Warenne and his descendants held the fairs and
markets from 1066. In 1792 the fair-days were the 6th of May,
Whit-Tuesday, the 26th of July (for wool), and the 2nd of
October. The market-day was Saturday. Fairs are now held
on the 6th of May for horses and cattle, the 20th of July for wool,
and the 21st and 28th of September for Southdown sheep.
A corn-market is held every Tuesday, and a stock-market every
alternate Monday. The trade in wool has been important since
the 14th century.</p>

<p>Lewes was the scene of the battle fought on the 14th of May
1264 between Henry III. and Simon de Montfort, earl of Leicester.
Led by the king and by his son, the future king Edward I., the
royalists left Oxford, took Northampton and drove Montfort
from Rochester into London. Then, harassed on the route by
their foes, they marched through Kent into Sussex and took up
their quarters at Lewes, a stronghold of the royalist Earl Warenne.
Meanwhile, reinforced by a number of Londoners, Earl Simon
left London and reached Fletching, about 9 m. north of Lewes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page522" id="page522"></a>522</span>
on the 13th of May. Efforts at reconciliation having failed he
led his army against the town, which he hoped to surprise, early
on the following day. His plan was to direct his main attack
against the priory of St Pancras, which sheltered the king and
his brother Richard, earl of Cornwall, king of the Romans,
while causing the enemy to believe that his principal objective
was the castle, where Prince Edward was. But the surprise
was not complete and the royalists rushed from the town to
meet the enemy in the open field. Edward led his followers
against the Londoners, who were gathered around the standard
of Montfort, put them to flight, pursued them for several miles,
and killed a great number of them. Montfort&rsquo;s ruse, however,
had been successful. He was not with his standard as his foes
thought, but with the pick of his men he attacked Henry&rsquo;s
followers and took prisoner both the king and his brother.
Before Edward returned from his chase the earl was in possession
of the town. In its streets the prince strove to retrieve his
fortunes, but in vain. Many of his men perished in the river,
but others escaped, one band, consisting of Earl Warenne and
others, taking refuge in Pevensey Castle. Edward himself took
sanctuary and on the following day peace was made between
the king and the earl.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEWES,<a name="ar44" id="ar44"></a></span> a town in Sussex county, Delaware, U.S.A., in the
S.E. part of the state, on Delaware Bay. Pop. (1910), 2158.
Lewes is served by the Philadelphia, Baltimore &amp; Washington
(Pennsylvania System), and the Maryland, Delaware &amp; Virginia
railways. Its harbour is formed by the Delaware Breakwater,
built by the national government and completed in 1869, and
2¼ m. above it another breakwater was completed in December
1901 by the government. The cove between them forms a
harbour of refuge of about 550 acres. At the mouth of Delaware
Bay, about 2 m. below Lewes, is the Henlopen Light, one of
the oldest lighthouses in America. The Delaware Bay pilots
make their headquarters at Lewes. Lewes has a large trade with
northern cities in fruits and vegetables, and is a subport of entry
of the Wilmington Customs District. The first settlement on
Delaware soil by Europeans was made near here in 1631 by
Dutch colonists, sent by a company organized in Holland in
the previous year by Samuel Blommaert, Killian van Rensselaer,
David Pieterszen de Vries and others. The settlers called the
place Zwaanendael, valley of swans. The settlement was soon
entirely destroyed by the Indians, and a second body of settlers
whom de Vries, who had been made director of the colony,
brought in 1632 remained for only two years. The fact of the
settlement is important; because of it the English did not unite
the Delaware country with Maryland, for the Maryland Charter
of 1632 restricted colonization to land within the prescribed
boundaries, uncultivated and either uninhabited or inhabited
only by Indians. In 1658 the Dutch established an Indian
trading post, and in 1659 erected a fort at Zwaanendael. After
the annexation of the Delaware counties to Pennsylvania in 1682,
its name was changed to Lewes, after the town of that name in
Sussex, England. It was pillaged by French pirates in 1698.
One of the last naval battles of the War of Independence was
fought in the bay near Lewes on the 8th of April 1782, when the
American privateer &ldquo;Hyder Ally&rdquo; (16), commanded by Captain
Joshua Barnes (1759-1818), defeated and captured the British
sloop &ldquo;General Monk&rdquo; (20), which had been an American
privateer, the &ldquo;General Washington,&rdquo; had been captured by
Admiral Arbuthnot&rsquo;s squadron in 1780, and was now purchased
by the United States government and, as the &ldquo;General
Washington,&rdquo; was commanded by Captain Barnes in 1782-1784.
In March 1813 the town was bombarded by a British
frigate.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEWIS, SIR GEORGE CORNEWALL,<a name="ar45" id="ar45"></a></span> <span class="sc">Bart.</span> (1806-1863),
English statesman and man of letters, was born in London on
the 21st of April 1806. His father, Thomas F. Lewis, of Harpton
Court, Radnorshire, after holding subordinate office in various
administrations, became a poor-law commissioner, and was made
a baronet in 1846. Young Lewis was educated at Eton and at
Christ Church, Oxford, where in 1828 he took a first-class in
classics and a second-class in mathematics. He then entered
the Middle Temple, and was called to the bar in 1831. In 1833
he undertook his first public work as one of the commissioners
to inquire into the condition of the poor Irish residents in the
United Kingdom.<a name="fa1c" id="fa1c" href="#ft1c"><span class="sp">1</span></a> In 1834 Lord Althorp included him in the
commission to inquire into the state of church property and
church affairs generally in Ireland. To this fact we owe his work
on <i>Local Disturbances in Ireland, and the Irish Church Question</i>
(London, 1836), in which he condemned the existing connexion
between church and state, proposed a state provision for the
Catholic clergy, and maintained the necessity of an efficient
workhouse organization. During this period Lewis&rsquo;s mind
was much occupied with the study of language. Before leaving
college he had published some observations on Whately&rsquo;s doctrine
of the predicables, and soon afterwards he assisted Thirlwall
and Hare in starting the <i>Philological Museum</i>. Its successor,
the <i>Classical Museum</i>, he also supported by occasional contributions.
In 1835 he published an <i>Essay on the Origin and Formation
of the Romance Languages</i> (re-edited in 1862), the first
effective criticism in England of Raynouard&rsquo;s theory of a uniform
romance tongue, represented by the poetry of the troubadours.
He also compiled a glossary of provincial words used in Herefordshire
and the adjoining counties. But the most important work
of this earlier period was one to which his logical and philological
tastes contributed. <i>The Remarks on the Use and Abuse of some
Political Terms</i> (London, 1832) may have been suggested by
Bentham&rsquo;s <i>Book of Parliamentary Fallacies</i>, but it shows all
that power of clear sober original thinking which marks his
larger and later political works. Moreover, he translated
Boeckh&rsquo;s <i>Public Economy of Athens</i> and Müller&rsquo;s <i>History of
Greek Literature</i>, and he assisted Tufnell in the translation of
Müller&rsquo;s <i>Dorians</i>. Some time afterwards he edited a text of
the <i>Fables</i> of Babrius. While his friend Hayward conducted
the <i>Law Magazine</i>, he wrote in it frequently on such subjects as
secondary punishments and the penitentiary system. In 1836,
at the request of Lord Glenelg, he accompanied John Austin to
Malta, where they spent nearly two years reporting on the
condition of the island and framing a new code of laws. One
leading object of both commissioners was to associate the Maltese
in the responsible government of the island. On his return to
England Lewis succeeded his father as one of the principal
poor-law commissioners. In 1841 appeared the <i>Essay on the
Government of Dependencies</i>, a systematic statement and discussion
of the various relations in which colonies may stand
towards the mother country. In 1844 Lewis married Lady Maria
Theresa Lister, sister of Lord Clarendon, and a lady of literary
tastes. Much of their married life was spent in Kent House,
Knightsbridge. They had no children. In 1847 Lewis resigned
his office. He was then returned for the county of Hereford,
and Lord John Russell appointed him secretary to the Board of
Control, but a few months afterwards he became under-secretary
to the Home Office. In this capacity he introduced two important
bills, one for the abolition of turnpike trusts and the management
of highways by a mixed county board, the other for the purpose
of defining and regulating the law of parochial assessment. In
1850 he succeeded Hayter as financial secretary to the treasury.
About this time, also, appeared his <i>Essay on the Influence of
Authority in Matters of Opinion</i>. On the dissolution of parliament
which followed the resignation of Lord John Russell&rsquo;s
ministry in 1852, Lewis was defeated for Herefordshire and then
for Peterborough. Excluded from parliament he accepted the
editorship of the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, and remained editor until
1855. During this period he served on the Oxford commission,
and on the commission to inquire into the government of London.
But its chief fruits were the <i>Treatise on the Methods of Observation
and Reasoning in Politics</i>, and the <i>Enquiry into the Credibility
of the Early Roman History</i>,<a name="fa2c" id="fa2c" href="#ft2c"><span class="sp">2</span></a> in which he vigorously attacked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page523" id="page523"></a>523</span>
the theory of epic lays and other theories on which Niebuhr&rsquo;s
reconstruction of that history had proceeded. In 1855 Lewis
succeeded his father in the baronetcy. He was at once elected
member for the Radnor boroughs, and Lord Palmerston made
him chancellor of the exchequer. He had a war loan to contract
and heavy additional taxation to impose, but his industry,
method and clear vision carried him safely through. After
the change of ministry in 1859 Sir George became home secretary
under Lord Palmerston, and in 1861, much against his wish,
he succeeded Sidney Herbert (Lord Herbert of Lea) at the
War Office. The closing years of his life were marked by increasing
intellectual vigour. In 1859 he published an able
<i>Essay on Foreign Jurisdiction and the Extradition of Criminals</i>,
a subject to which the attempt on Napoleon&rsquo;s life, the discussions
on the Conspiracy Bill, and the trial of Bernard, had drawn
general attention. He advocated the extension of extradition
treaties, and condemned the principal idea of <i>Weltrechtsordnung</i>
which Mohl of Heidelberg had proposed. His two latest works
were the <i>Survey of the Astronomy of the Ancients</i>, in which,
without professing any knowledge of Oriental languages, he
applied a sceptical analysis to the ambitious Egyptology of
Bunsen; and the <i>Dialogue on the Best Form of Government</i>, in
which, under the name of Crito, the author points out to the
supporters of the various systems that there is no one abstract
government which is the best possible for all times and places.
An essay on the <i>Characteristics of Federal, National, Provincial
and Municipal Government</i> does not seem to have been published.
Sir George died in April 1863. A marble bust by Weekes stands
in Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p>Lewis was a man of mild and affectionate disposition, much
beloved by a large circle of friends, among whom were Sir E.
Head, the Grotes, the Austins, Lord Stanhope, J. S. Mill, Dean
Milman, the Duff Gordons. In public life he was distinguished,
as Lord Aberdeen said, &ldquo;for candour, moderation, love of truth.&rdquo;
He had a passion for the systematic acquirement of knowledge,
and a keen and sound critical faculty. His name has gone down
to history as that of a many-sided man, sound in judgment,
unselfish in political life, and abounding in practical good sense.</p>

<div class="condensed">

<p><span class="bold">LEWIS, HENRY CARVILL<a name="ar46" id="ar46"></a></span> (1853-1888), American geologist,
was born in Philadelphia on the 16th of November 1853.
Educated in the university of Pennsylvania he took the degree of
M.A. in 1876. He became attached to the Geological Survey of
Pennsylvania in 1879, serving for three years as a volunteer
member, and during this term he became greatly interested in the
study of glacial phenomena. In 1880 he was chosen professor of
mineralogy in the Philadelphia academy of natural sciences, and
in 1883 he was appointed to the chair of geology in Haverford
College, Pennsylvania. During the winters of 1885 to 1887 he
studied petrology under H. F. Rosenbusch at Heidelberg, and
during the summers he investigated the glacial geology of
northern Europe and the British Islands. His observations
in North America, where he had studied under Professor G. F.
Wright, Professor T. C. Chamberlin and Warren Upham, had
demonstrated the former extension of land-ice, and the existence
of great terminal moraines. In 1884 his <i>Report on the Terminal
Moraine in Pennsylvania and New York</i> was published: a
work containing much information on the limits of the North
American ice-sheet. In Britain he sought to trace in like manner
the southern extent of the terminal moraines formed by British
ice-sheets, but before his conclusions were matured he died
at Manchester on the 21st of July 1888. The results of his
observations were published in 1894 entitled <i>Papers and Notes
on the Glacial Geology of Great Britain and Ireland</i>, edited by
Dr H. W. Crosskey.</p>

son of F. C. Lewis, engraver, was born in London. He was
elected in 1827 associate of the Society of Painters in Water
Colours, of which he became full member in 1829 and president
in 1855; he resigned in 1858, and was made associate of the
Royal Academy in 1859 and academician in 1865. Much of his
earlier life was spent in Spain, Italy and the East, but he returned
to England in 1851 and for the remainder of his career
devoted himself almost exclusively to Eastern subjects, which
he treated with extraordinary care and minuteness of finish,
and with much beauty of technical method. He is represented
by a picture, &ldquo;Edfou: Upper Egypt,&rdquo; in the National Gallery
of British Art. He achieved equal eminence in both oil and

<p><span class="bold">LEWIS, MATTHEW GREGORY<a name="ar48" id="ar48"></a></span> (1775-1818), English
romance-writer and dramatist, often referred to as &ldquo;Monk&rdquo;
Lewis, was born in London on the 9th of July 1775. He was
educated for a diplomatic career at Westminster school and at
Christ Church, Oxford, spending most of his vacations abroad
in the study of modern languages; and in 1794 he proceeded to
the Hague as attaché to the British embassy. His stay there
lasted only a few months, but was marked by the composition,
in ten weeks, of his romance <i>Ambrosio, or the Monk</i>, which was
published in the summer of the following year. It immediately
achieved celebrity; but some passages it contained were of such
a nature that about a year after its appearance an injunction to
restrain its sale was moved for and a rule <i>nisi</i> obtained. Lewis
published a second edition from which he had expunged, as he
thought, all the objectionable passages, but the work still
remains of such a character as almost to justify the severe
language in which Byron in <i>English Bards and Scotch Reviewers</i>
addresses&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg f90" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">

</div> </td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">Whatever its demerits, ethical or aesthetic, may have been, <i>The
Monk</i> did not interfere with the reception of Lewis into the best
English society; he was favourably noticed at court, and almost
as soon as he came of age he obtained a seat in the House
of Commons as member for Hindon, Wilts. After some years,
however, during which he never addressed the House, he finally
withdrew from a parliamentary career. His tastes lay wholly in
the direction of literature, and <i>The Castle Spectre</i> (1796, a musical
drama of no great literary merit, but which enjoyed a long
popularity on the stage), <i>The Minister</i> (a translation from
Schiller&rsquo;s <i>Kabale u. Liebe</i>), <i>Rolla</i> (1797, a translation from
Kotzebue), with numerous other operatic and tragic pieces,
appeared in rapid succession. <i>The Bravo of Venice</i>, a romance
translated from the German, was published in 1804; next to
<i>The Monk</i> it is the best known work of Lewis. By the death of
his father he succeeded to a large fortune, and in 1815 embarked
for the West Indies to visit his estates; in the course of this
tour, which lasted four months, the <i>Journal of a West Indian
Proprietor</i>, published posthumously in 1833, was written. A
second visit to Jamaica was undertaken in 1817, in order that
he might become further acquainted with, and able to ameliorate,
the condition of the slave population; the fatigues to
which he exposed himself in the tropical climate brought on a
fever which terminated fatally on the homeward voyage on the
14th of May 1818.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEWIS, MERIWETHER<a name="ar49" id="ar49"></a></span> (1774-1809), American explorer,
was born near Charlottesville, Virginia, on the 18th of August
1774. In 1794 he volunteered with the Virginia troops called
out to suppress the &ldquo;Whisky Insurrection,&rdquo; was commissioned
as ensign in the regular United States army in 1795, served with
distinction under General Anthony Wayne in the campaigns
against the Indians, and attained the rank of captain in 1797.
From 1801 to 1803 he was the private secretary of President
Jefferson. On the 18th of January 1803 Jefferson sent a confidential
message to Congress urging the development of trade
with the Indians of the Missouri Valley and recommending that
an exploring party be sent into this region, notwithstanding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page524" id="page524"></a>524</span>
the fact that it was then held by Spain and owned by France.
Congress appropriated funds for the expedition, and the president
instructed Lewis to proceed to the head-waters of the Missouri
river and thence across the mountains to the Pacific Ocean.
With Jefferson&rsquo;s consent Lewis chose as a companion Lieut.
William Clark, an old friend and army comrade. The preparations
were made under the orders of the War Department, and,
until the news arrived that France had sold Louisiana to the
United States, they were conducted in secrecy. Lewis spent
some time in Philadelphia, gaining additional knowledge of the
natural sciences and learning the use of instruments for determining
positions; and late in 1803 he and Clark, with twenty-nine
men from the army, went into winter quarters near St
Louis, where the men were subjected to rigid training. On the
14th of May 1804 the party, with sixteen additional members,
who, however, were to go only a part of the way, started up the
Missouri river in three boats, and by the 2nd of November had
made the difficult ascent of the stream as far as 47° 21&prime; N. lat.,
near the site of the present Bismarck, North Dakota, where,
among the Mandan Indians, they passed the second winter.
Early in April 1805 the ascent of the Missouri was continued as
far as the three forks of the river, which were named the Jefferson,
the Gallatin and the Madison. The Jefferson was then
followed to its source in the south-western part of what is now
the state of Montana. Procuring a guide and horses from the
Shoshone Indians, the party pushed westward through the Rocky
Mountains in September, and on the 7th of October embarked
in canoes on a tributary of the Columbia river, the mouth of
which they reached on the 15th of November. They had
travelled upwards of 4000 m. from their starting-point, had
encountered various Indian tribes never before seen by whites,
had made valuable scientific collections and observations, and
were the first explorers to reach the Pacific by crossing the
continent north of Mexico. After spending the winter on the
Pacific coast they started on the 23rd of March 1806 on their
return journey, and, after crossing the divide, Lewis with
one party explored Maria&rsquo;s river, and Clark with another the
Yellowstone. On the 12th of August the two explorers reunited
near the junction of the Yellowstone and the Missouri, and on
the 23rd of September reached St Louis. In spite of exposure,
hardship and peril only one member of the party died, and
only one deserted. No later feat of exploration, perhaps, in
any quarter of the globe has exceeded this in romantic interest.
The expedition was commemorated by the Lewis and Clark
Centennial Exposition at Portland, Oregon, in 1905. The leaders
and men of the exploring party were rewarded with liberal grants
of land from the public domain, Lewis receiving 1500 acres; and
in March 1807 Lewis was made governor of the northern part
of the territory obtained from France in 1803, which had been
organized as the Louisiana Territory. He performed the duties
of this office with great efficiency, but it is said that in the unwonted
quiet of his new duties, his mind, always subject to
melancholy, became unbalanced, and that while on his way to
Washington he committed suicide about 60 m. south-west
of Nashville, Tennessee, on the 11th of October 1809. It is not
definitely known, however, whether he actually committed
suicide or was murdered.</p>

Pennsylvania and the Philadelphia &amp; Reading railways. It is
the seat of Bucknell University (coeducational), opened in 1846
as the university of Lewisburg and renamed in 1886 in honour
of William Bucknell (1809-1890), a liberal benefactor. The
university comprises a College of Liberal Arts, an Academy for
Young Men, an Institute for Young Women, and a School of
Music, and in 1908-1909 had 50 instructors and 775 students,
of whom 547 were in the College of Liberal Arts. The city is
situated in a farming region, and has various manufactures,
including flour, lumber, furniture, woollens, nails, foundry
products and carriages. Lewisburg (until about 1805 called
Derrstown) was founded and laid out in 1785 by Ludwig Derr,

by Woolwich, and W. by Camberwell, and extending S. to the
boundary of the county of London. Pop. (1901) 127,495. Its
area is for the most part occupied by villas. It includes the
districts of Blackheath and Lee in the north, Hither Green,
Catford and Brockley in the central parts, and Forest Hill and
part of Sydenham in the south-west. In the districts last named
well-wooded hills rise above 300 ft., and this is an especially
favoured residential quarter, its popularity being formerly
increased by the presence of medicinal springs, discovered in
1640, on Sydenham Common. Towards the south, in spite of the
constant extension of building, there are considerable tracts of
ground uncovered, apart from public grounds. In the north the
borough includes the greater part of Blackheath (<i>q.v.</i>), an open
common of considerable historical interest. The other principal
pleasure grounds are Hilly Fields (46 acres) and Ladywell Recreation
Grounds (46 acres) in the north-west part of the borough;
and at Sydenham (but outside the boundary of the county of
London) is the Crystal Palace. Among institutions are the
Horniman Museum, Forest Hill (1901); Morden&rsquo;s College, on the
south of Blackheath, founded at the close of the 17th century by
Sir John Morden for Turkey merchants who were received as
pensioners, and subsequently extended in scope; numerous

<p><span class="bold">LEWISTON,<a name="ar52" id="ar52"></a></span> a city of Androscoggin county, Maine, U.S.A.,
on the Androscoggin river, opposite Auburn, with which it is
connected by four steel bridges, and about 36 m. N.E. of Portland.
Pop. (1900) 23,761, of whom 9316 were foreign-born; (1910
census) 26,247. It is served by the Maine Central, the Grand
Trunk, the Portland &amp; Rumford Falls and the Lewiston, Augusta
&amp; Waterville (electric) railways. The surrounding country
is hilly and the river is picturesque; in the vicinity there are
many lakes and ponds abounding in salmon and trout. The
Maine fish hatchery is on Lake Auburn, 3 m. above the city.
Lewiston is the seat of Bates College, a non-sectarian institution,
which grew out of the Maine State Seminary (chartered in 1855),
and was chartered in 1864 under its present name, adopted in
honour of Benjamin E. Bates (d. 1877), a liberal benefactor.
In 1908-1909 the college had 25 instructors and 440 students,
and its library contained 34,000 volumes. The campus of the
college is about 1 m. from the business portion of Lewiston and
covers 50 acres; among the college buildings are an auditorium
(1909) given by W. Scott Libbey of Lewiston, and the Libbey
Forum for the use of the three literary societies and the two
Christian associations of the college. The literary societies
give excellent training in forensics. The matriculation pledge
requires from male students total abstinence from intoxicants
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page525" id="page525"></a>525</span>
as a condition of membership. There are no secret fraternities.
From the beginning women have been admitted on the same
terms as men. The Cobb Divinity School (Free Baptist), which
was founded at Parsonfield, Maine, in 1840 as a department
of Parsonfield Seminary, and was situated in 1842-1844 at
Dracut, Massachusetts, in 1844-1854 at Whitestown, New York,
and in 1854-1870 at New Hampton, New Hampshire, was
removed to Lewiston in 1870 and became a department (known
as Bates Theological Seminary until 1888) of Bates College,
with which it was merged in 1908. Lewiston has a fine city
hall, a Carnegie library and a public park of 10½ acres, with a
bronze soldiers&rsquo; monument by Franklin Simmons, who was born
in 1839 at Webster near Lewiston, and is known for his statues
of Roger Williams, William King, Francis H. Pierpont and U. S.
Grant in the national Capitol, and for &ldquo;Grief&rdquo; and &ldquo;History&rdquo; on
the Peace Monument at Washington. In Lewiston are the
Central Maine General Hospital (1888), the Sisters&rsquo; Hospital
(1888), under the charge of the French Catholic Sisters of Charity,
a home for aged women, a young women&rsquo;s home and the
Hesley Asylum for boys. The Shrine Building (Kora Temple),
dedicated in 1909, is the headquarters of the Shriners of the
state. The river at Lewiston breaks over a ledge of mica-schist
and gneiss, the natural fall of 40 ft. having been increased to
more than 50 ft. by a strong granite dam; and 3 m. above the
city at Deer Rips a cement dam furnishes 10,000 horse-power.
The water-power thus obtained is distributed by canals from
the nearer dam and transmitted by wire from the upper dam.
The manufacture of cotton goods is the principal industry, and
in 1905 the product of the city&rsquo;s cotton mills was valued at about
one-third of that of the mills of the whole state. Among other
industries are the manufacture of woollen goods, shirts, dry-plates,
carriages, spools and bobbins, and boots and shoes, and
the dyeing and finishing of textiles. The total factory product
in 1905 was valued at $8,527,649. The municipality owns its
water works and electric lighting plant. Lewiston was settled
in 1770, incorporated as a township in 1795 and chartered as a
city in 1861. It was the home of Nelson Dingley (1832-1899),
who from 1856 until his death controlled the Lewiston <i>Journal</i>.
He was governor of the state in 1874-1876, Republican representative
in Congress in 1881-1899, and the drafter of the Dingley
Tariff Bill (1897).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEWIS-WITH-HARRIS,<a name="ar53" id="ar53"></a></span> the most northerly island of the
Outer Hebrides, Scotland. It is sometimes called the Long
Island and is 24 m. from the nearest point of the mainland,
from which it is separated by the strait called The Minch. It
is 60 m. long and has an extreme breadth of 30 m., its average
breadth being 15 m. It is divided into two portions by a line
roughly drawn between Loch Resort on the west and Loch
Seaforth on the east, of which the larger or more northerly portion,
known as Lewis (pron. <i>Lews</i>), belongs to the county of Ross and
Cromarty and the lesser, known as Harris, to Inverness-shire.
The area of the whole island is 492,800 acres, or 770 sq. m., of
which 368,000 acres belong to Lewis. In 1891 the population
of Lewis was 27,045, of Harris 3681; in 1901 the population
of Lewis was 28,357, of Harris 3803, or 32,160 for the island,
of whom 17,175 were females, 11,209 spoke Gaelic only, and

indented to a remarkable degree, the principal sea-lochs in
Harris being East and West Loch Tarbert; and in Lewis, Loch
Seaforth, Loch Erisort and Broad Bay (or Loch a Tuath) on the
east coast and Loch Roag and Loch Resort on the west. The
mainland is dotted with innumerable fresh-water lakes. The
island is composed of gneiss rocks, excepting a patch of granite
near Carloway, small bands of intrusive basalt at Gress and in
Eye Peninsula and some Torridonian sandstone at Stornoway,
Tong, Vatskir and Carloway. Most of Harris is mountainous,
there being more than thirty peaks above 1000 ft. high. Lewis
is comparatively flat, save in the south-east, where Ben More
reaches 1874 ft., and in the south-west, where Mealasbhal (1885)
is the highest point; but in this division there are only eleven
peaks exceeding 1000 ft. in height. The rivers are small and
unimportant. The principal capes are the Butt of Lewis, in
the extreme north, where the cliffs are nearly 150 ft. high and
crowned with a lighthouse, the light of which is visible for 19 m.;
Tolsta Head, Tiumpan Head and Cabag Head, on the east;
Renish Point, in the extreme south; and, on the west, Toe Head
and Gallon Head. The following inhabited islands in the
Inverness-shire division belong to the parish of Harris: off the
S.W. coast, Bernera (pop. 524), Ensay, Killigray and Pabbay;
off the W. coast, Scarp (160), Soay and Tarrensay (72); off the
E. coast, Scalpa (587) and Scotasay. Belonging to the county
of Ross and Cromarty are Great Bernera (580) to the W. of Lewis,
in the parish of Uig, and the Shiant Isles, about 21 m. S. of
Stornoway, in the parish of Lochs, so named from the number
of its sea lochs and fresh-water lakes. The south-eastern base
of Broad Bay is furnished by the peninsula of Eye, attached to
the main mass by so slender a neck as seemingly to be on the
point of becoming itself an island. Much of the surface of both
Lewis and Harris is composed of peat and swamp; there are
scanty fragments of an ancient forest. The rainfall for the year
averages 41.7 in., autumn and winter being very wet. Owing
to the influence of the Gulf Stream, however, the temperature
is fairly high, averaging for the year 46.6° F., for January 39.5° F.
and for August 56.5° F.</p>

<p>The economic conditions of the island correspond with its
physical conditions. The amount of cultivable land is small
and poor. Sir James Matheson (1796-1878), who purchased
the island in 1844, is said to have spent nearly £350,000 in
reclamation and improvements. Barley and potatoes are the
chief crops. A large number of black cattle are reared and some
sheep-farming is carried on in Harris. Kelp-making, once
important, has been extinct for many years. Harris has obtained
great reputation for tweeds. The cloth has an aroma of heather
and peat, and is made in the dwellings of the cotters, who use
dyes of long-established excellence. The fisheries are the
principal mainstay of the people. In spite of the very considerable
reductions in rent effected by the Crofters&rsquo; Commission
(appointed in 1886) and the sums expended by government,
most of the crofters still live in poor huts amid dismal surroundings.
The island affords good sporting facilities. Many of the
streams abound with salmon and trout; otters and seals are
plentiful, and deer and hares common; while bird life includes
grouse, ptarmigan, woodcock, snipe, heron, widgeon, teal, eider
duck, swan and varieties of geese and gulls. There are many
antiquarian remains, including duns, megaliths, ruined towers
and chapels and the like. At <span class="sc">Rodel</span>, in the extreme south of
Harris, is a church, all that is left of an Augustinian monastery.
The foundation is Norman and the superstructure Early English.
On the towers are curious carved figures and in the interior
several tombs of the Macleods, the most remarkable being that
of Alastair (Alexander), son of William Macleod of Dunvegan,
dated 1528. The monument, a full-length recumbent effigy
of a knight in armour, lies at the base of a tablet in the shape
of an arch divided into compartments, in which are carved in
bas-relief, besides the armorial bearings of the deceased and a
rendering of Dunvegan castle, several symbolical scenes, one of
which exhibits Satan weighing in the balance the good and evil
deeds of Alastair Macleod, the good obviously preponderating.
Stornoway, the chief town (pop. 3852) is treated under a separate
heading. At <span class="sc">Callernish</span>, 13 m. due W. of Stornoway, are
several stone circles, one of which is probably the most perfect
example of so-called &ldquo;Druidical&rdquo; structures in the British Isles.
In this specimen the stones are huge, moss-covered, undressed
blocks of gneiss. Twelve of such monoliths constitute the
circle, in the centre of which stands a pillar 17 ft. high. From
the circle there runs northwards an avenue of stones, comprising
on the right-hand side nine blocks and on the left-hand ten.
There also branch off from the circle, on the east and west, a
single line of four stones and, on the south, a single line of five
stones. From the extreme point of the south file to the farther
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page526" id="page526"></a>526</span>
end of the avenue on the north is a distance of 127 yds. and the
width from tip to tip of the east and west arms is 41 yds. Viewed
from the north end of the avenue, the design is that of a cross.
The most important fishery centre on the west coast is Carloway,
where there is the best example of a broch, or fort, in the Hebrides.
Rory, the blind harper who translated the Psalms into Gaelic,
was born in the village. Tarbert, at the head of East Loch
Tarbert, is a neat, clean village, in communication by mail-car
with Stornoway. At Coll, a few miles N. by E. of Stornoway,
is a mussel cave; and at Gress, 2 m. or so beyond in the same
direction, there is a famous seals&rsquo; cave, adorned with fine stalactites.
Port of Ness, where there is a harbour, is the headquarters
of the ling fishery. Loch Seaforth gave the title of
earl to a branch of the Mackenzies, but in 1716 the 5th earl was
attainted for Jacobitism and the title forfeited. In 1797
Francis Humberston Mackenzie (1754-1815), chief of the Clan
Mackenzie, was created Lord Seaforth and Baron Mackenzie
of Kintail, and made colonel of the 2nd battalion of the North
British Militia, afterwards the 3rd battalion of the Seaforth
Highlanders. The 2nd battalion of the Seaforth Highlanders
was formerly the Ross-shire Buffs, which was raised in 1771.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEXINGTON, BARON,<a name="ar55" id="ar55"></a></span> a title borne in the English family of
Sutton from 1645 to 1723. Robert Sutton (1594-1668), son of
Sir William Sutton of Averham, Nottinghamshire, was a member
of parliament for his native county in 1625 and again in 1640.
He served Charles I. during the Civil War, making great
monetary sacrifices for the royal cause, and in 1645 the king
created him Baron Lexington, this being a variant of the
name of the Nottinghamshire village of Laxton. His estate
suffered during the time of the Commonwealth, but some money
was returned to him by Charles II. He died on the 13th of
October 1668. His only son, Robert, the 2nd baron (1661-1723),
supported in the House of Lords the elevation of William of
Orange to the throne, and was employed by that king at court
and on diplomatic business. He also served as a soldier, but he
is chiefly known as the British envoy at Vienna during the
conclusion of the treaty of Ryswick, and at Madrid during the
negotiations which led to the treaty of Utrecht. He died on
the 19th of September 1723. His letters from Vienna, selected
and edited by the Hon. H. M. Sutton, were published as the
<i>Lexington Papers</i> (1851). Lexington&rsquo;s barony became extinct
on his death, but his estates descended to the younger sons of
his daughter Bridget (d. 1734), the wife of John Manners, 3rd
duke of Rutland. Lord George Manners, who inherited these
estates in 1762, is the ancestor of the family of Manners-Sutton.
An earlier member of this family is Oliver Sutton, bishop of
Lincoln from 1280 to 1299.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEXINGTON,<a name="ar56" id="ar56"></a></span> a city and the county-seat of Fayette county,
Kentucky, U.S.A., about 75 m. S. of Cincinnati. Pop. (1900)
26,369, of whom 10,130 were negroes and 924 were foreign-born;
(1910 census), 35,099. It is served by the Louisville &amp; Nashville,
the Southern, the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio, the Cincinnati,
New Orleans &amp; Texas Pacific, the Lexington &amp; Eastern,
and electric railways. The city, which lies at an altitude of
about 950 ft., is situated near the centre of the celebrated &ldquo;blue
grass&rdquo; region, into which extend a number of turnpike roads.
Its public buildings include the court house and the Federal
building, both built of Bowling Green oolitic limestone. Among
the public institutions are two general hospitals&mdash;St Joseph&rsquo;s
(Roman Catholic) and Good Samaritan (controlled by the
Protestant churches of the city)&mdash;the Eastern Lunatic Asylum
(1815, a state institution since 1824), with 250 acres of grounds;
a state House of Reform for Girls and a state House of Reform
for Boys (both at Greendale, a suburb); an orphan industrial
school (for negroes); and two Widows&rsquo; and Orphans&rsquo; Homes,
one established by the Odd Fellows of Kentucky and the other
by the Knights of Pythias of the state. Lexington is the seat
of Transylvania University (non-sectarian; coeducational),
formerly Kentucky University (Disciples of Christ), which grew
out of Bacon College (opened at Georgetown, Ky., in 1836),
was chartered in 1858 as Kentucky University, and was opened
at Harrodsburg, Ky., in 1859, whence after a fire in 1864 it
removed to Lexington in 1865. At Lexington it was consolidated
with the old Transylvania University, a well-known institution
which had been chartered as Transylvania Seminary in 1783,
was opened near Danville, Ky., in 1785, was removed to Lexington
in 1789, was re-chartered as Transylvania University in
1798, and virtually ceased to exist in 1859.<a name="fa1d" id="fa1d" href="#ft1d"><span class="sp">1</span></a> In 1908 Kentucky
University resumed the old name, Transylvania University.
It has a college of Liberal Arts, a College of Law, a Preparatory
School, a Junior College for Women, and Hamilton College for
women (founded in 1869 as Hocker Female College), over which
the university assumed control in 1903, and a College of the Bible,
organized in 1865 as one of the colleges of the university, but
now under independent control. In 1907-1908 Transylvania
University, including the College of the Bible, had 1129 students.
At Lexington are the State University, two colleges for girls&mdash;the
Campbell-Hagerman College and Sayre College&mdash;and St
Catherine&rsquo;s Academy (Roman Catholic). The city is the meeting-place
of a Chatauqua Assembly, and has a public library. The
State University was founded (under the Federal Land Grant
Act of 1862) in 1865 as the State Agricultural and Mechanical
College, was opened in 1866, and was a college of Kentucky
University until 1878. In 1890 the college received a second
Federal appropriation, and it received various grants from the
state legislature, which in 1880 imposed a state tax of one-half of
1% for its support. In connexion with it an Agricultural
Experiment Station was established in 1885. In 1908 its title
became, by act of Legislature, the State University. The
university has a College of Agriculture, a College of Arts and
Science, a College of Law, a School of Civil Engineering, a School
of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, and a School of mining
Engineering. The university campus is the former City Park,
in the southern part of the city. In 1907-1908 the university
had 1064 students. The city is the see of a Protestant Episcopal
bishopric.</p>

<p>Lexington was the home of Henry Clay from 1797 until his
death in 1852, and in his memory a monument has been erected,
consisting of a magnesian-limestone column (about 120 ft.) in
the Corinthian style and surmounted by a statue of Clay, the
head of which was torn off in 1902 by a thunderbolt. Clay&rsquo;s
estate, &ldquo;Ashland,&rdquo; is now one of the best known of the stock-farms
in the vicinity; the present house is a replica of Clay&rsquo;s
home. The finest and most extensive of these stock-farms, and
probably the finest in the world, is &ldquo;Elmendorf,&rdquo; 6 m. from the
city. On these farms many famous trotting and running horses
have been raised. There are two race-tracks in Lexington, and
annual running and trotting race meetings attract large crowds.
The city&rsquo;s industries consist chiefly in a large trade in tobacco,
hemp, grain and live stock&mdash;there are large semi-annual horse
sales&mdash;and in the manufacture of &ldquo;Bourbon&rdquo; whisky, tobacco,
flour, dressed flax and hemp, carriages, harness and saddles.
The total value of the city&rsquo;s factory products in 1905 was
$2,774,329 (46.9% more than in 1900).</p>

<p>Lexington was named from Lexington, Massachusetts, in 1775
by a party of hunters who were encamped here when they
received the news of the battle of Lexington; the permanent
settlement dates from 1779. It was laid out in 1781, incorporated
as a town in 1782, and chartered as a city in 1832. The
first newspaper published west of the Alleghany Mountains, the
<i>Kentucky Gazette</i>, was established here in 1787, to promote the
separation of Kentucky from Virginia. The first state legislature
met here in 1792, but later in the same year Frankfort became
the state capital. Until 1907, when the city was enlarged by
annexation, its limits remained as they were first laid out, a
circle with a radius of 1 m., the court house being its centre.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEXINGTON,<a name="ar57" id="ar57"></a></span> a township of Middlesex county, Massachusetts,
U.S.A., about 11 m. N.W. of Boston. Pop. (1900) 3831, (1910
U.S. census) 4918. It is traversed by the Boston &amp; Maine
railroad and by the Lowell &amp; Boston electric railway. Its area
is about 17 sq. m., and it contains three villages&mdash;Lexington,
East Lexington and North Lexington. Agriculture is virtually
the only industry. Owing to its historic interest the village of
Lexington is visited by thousands of persons annually, for it
was on the green or common of this village that the first armed
conflict of the American War of Independence occurred. On
the green stand a monument erected by the state in 1799 to the
memory of the minute-men who fell in that engagement, a
drinking fountain surmounted by a bronze statue (1900, by
Henry Hudson Kitson) of Captain John Parker, who was in
command of the minute-men, and a large boulder, which marks
the position of the minute-men when they were fired upon by
the British. Near the green, in the old burying-ground, are the
graves of Captain Parker and other American patriots&mdash;the
oldest gravestone is dated 1690. The Hancock-Clarke House
(built in part in 1698) is now owned by the Lexington Historical
Society and contains a museum of revolutionary and other relics,
which were formerly exhibited in the Town Hall. The Buckman
Tavern (built about 1690), the rendezvous of the minute-men,
and the Munroe Tavern (1695), the headquarters of the British,
are still standing, and two other houses, on the common, antedate
the War of Independence. The Cary Library in this village, with
23,000 volumes (1908), was founded in 1868, and was housed in
the Town Hall from 1871 until 1906, when it was removed to
the Cary Memorial Library building. In the library are portraits
of Paul Revere, William Dawes and Lord Percy. The Town
Hall (1871) contains statues of John Hancock (by Thomas R.
Gould) and Samuel Adams (by Martin Millmore), of the &ldquo;Minute-Man
of 1775&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Soldier of 1861,&rdquo; and a painting by
Henry Sandham, &ldquo;The Battle of Lexington.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lexington was settled as a part of Cambridge as early as 1642.
It was organized as a parish in 1691 and was made a township
(probably named in honour of Lord Lexington) in 1713. In the
evening of the 18th of April 1775 a British force of about 800
men under Lieut.-Colonel Francis Smith and Major John Pitcairn
was sent by General Thomas Gage from Boston to destroy
military stores collected by the colonists at Concord, and to
seize John Hancock and Samuel Adams, then at Parson Clarke&rsquo;s
house (now known as the Hancock-Clarke House) in Lexington.
Although the British had tried to keep this movement a secret,
Dr Joseph Warren discovered their plans and sent out Paul
Revere and William Dawes to give warning of their approach.
The expedition had not proceeded far when Smith, discovering
that the country was aroused, despatched an express to Boston
for reinforcements and ordered Pitcairn to hasten forward with
a detachment of light infantry. Early in the morning of the
19th Pitcairn arrived at the green in the village of Lexington,
and there found between sixty and seventy minute-men under
Captain John Parker drawn up in line of battle. Pitcairn
ordered them to disperse, and on their refusal to do so his men
fired a volley. Whether a stray shot preceded the first volley,
and from which side it came, are questions which have never
been determined. After a second volley from the British,
Parker ordered his men to withdraw. The engagement lasted
only a few minutes, but eight Americans were killed and nine
were wounded; not more than two or three of the British were
wounded. Hancock and Adams had escaped before the British
troops reached Lexington. The British proceeded from Lexington
to Concord (<i>q.v.</i>). On their return they were continually
fired upon by Americans from behind trees, rocks, buildings and
other defences, and were threatened with complete destruction
until they were rescued at Lexington by a force of 1000 men
under Lord Hugh Percy (later, 1786, duke of Northumberland).
Percy received the fugitives within a hollow square, checked
the onslaught for a time with two field-pieces, used the Munroe
Tavern for a hospital, and later in the day carried his command
with little further injury back to Boston. The British
losses for the entire day were 73 killed, 174 wounded and 26
missing; the American losses were 49 killed, 39 wounded and
5 missing.</p>

<p>In 1839 a state normal school for women (the first in Massachusetts
and the first public training school for teachers in the
United States) was opened at Lexington; it was transferred
to West Newton in 1844 and to Framingham in 1853.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEXINGTON,<a name="ar58" id="ar58"></a></span> a city and the county-seat of Lafayette county,
Missouri, U.S.A., situated on the S. bank of the Missouri river,
about 40 m. E. of Kansas City. Pop. (1900) 4190, including 1170
negroes and 283 foreign-born; (1910) 5242. It is served by the
Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fé, the Wabash (at Lexington
Junction, 4 m. N.W.), and the Missouri Pacific railway systems.
The city lies for the most part on high broken ground at the
summit of the river bluffs, but in part upon their face. Lexington
is the seat of the Lexington College for Young Women (Baptist,
established 1855), the Central College for Women (Methodist
Episcopal, South; opened 1869), and the Wentworth Military
Academy (1880). There are steam flour mills, furniture factories
and various other small manufactories; but the main economic
interest of the city is in brickyards and coal-mines in its immediate
vicinity. It is one of the principal coal centres of the state,
Higginsville (pop. in 1910, 2628), about 12 m. S.E., in the same
county, also being important. Lexington was founded in 1819,
was laid out in 1832, and, with various additions, was chartered
as a city in 1845. A new charter was received in 1870. Lexington
succeeded Sibley as the eastern terminus of the Santa Fé
trade, and was in turn displaced by Independence; it long owed
its prosperity to the freighting trade up the Missouri, and at the
opening of the Civil War it was the most important river town
between St Louis and St Joseph and commanded the approach
by water to Fort Leavenworth.</p>

<p>After the Confederate success at Wilson&rsquo;s Creek (Aug. 10,
1861), General Sterling Price advanced northward, and with
about 15,000 men arrived in the vicinity of Lexington on the
12th of September. Here he found a Federal force of about
2800 men under Colonel James A. Mulligan (1830-1864) throwing
up intrenchments on Masonic College Hill, an eminence adjoining
Lexington on the N.E. An attack was made on the same day
and the Federals were driven within their defences, but at night
General Price withdrew to the Fair-grounds not far away and
remained there five days waiting for his wagon train and for
reinforcements. On the 18th the assault was renewed, and on the
20th the Confederates, advancing behind movable breastworks
of water-soaked bales of hemp, forced the besieged, now long
without water, to surrender. The losses were: Confederate,
25 killed and 75 wounded; Federal, 39 killed and 120 wounded.
At the end of September General Price withdrew, leaving a guard
of only a few hundred in the town, and on the 16th of the next
month a party of 220 Federal scouts under Major Frank J. White
(1842-1875) surprised this guard, released about 15 prisoners,
and captured 60 or more Confederates. Another Federal raid
on the town was made in December of the same year by General
John Pope&rsquo;s cavalry. Again, during General Price&rsquo;s Missouri
expedition in 1864, a Federal force entered Lexington on the 16th
of October, and three days later there was some fighting about
4 m. S. of the town.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEXINGTON,<a name="ar59" id="ar59"></a></span> a town and the county-seat of Rockbridge
county, Virginia, U.S.A., on the North river (a branch of the
James), about 30 m. N.N.W. of Lynchburg. Pop. (1900) 3203
(1252 negroes); (1910) 2931. It is served by the Chesapeake
&amp; Ohio and the Baltimore &amp; Ohio railways. The famous
Natural Bridge is about 16 m. S.W., and there are mineral springs
in the vicinity&mdash;at Rockbridge Baths, 10 m. N., at Wilson&rsquo;s
Springs, 12 m. N., and at Rockbridge Alum Springs, 17 m. N.W.
Lexington is best known as the seat of Washington and Lee
University, and of the Virginia Military Institute. The former
grew out of Augusta Academy, which was established in 1749
in Augusta county, about 15 m. S.W. of what is now the city of
Staunton, was renamed Liberty Hall and was established near
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page528" id="page528"></a>528</span>
Lexington in 1780, and was chartered as Liberty Hall Academy
in 1782. In 1798 its name was changed to Washington Academy,
in recognition of a gift from George Washington of some
shares of canal stock, which he refused to receive from the
Virginia legislature. In 1802 the Virginia branch of the Society
of the Cincinnati disbanded and turned over to the academy its
funds, about $25,000; in 1813 the academy took the name
Washington College; and in 1871 its corporate name was changed
to Washington and Lee University, the addition to the name
being made in honour of General Robert E. Lee, who was the
president of the college from August 1865 until his death in 1870.
He was succeeded by his son, General George Washington
Custis Lee (b. 1832), president from 1871 to 1897, and Dr William
Lyne Wilson (1843-1900), the eminent political leader and
educator, was president from 1897 to 1900. In 1908-1909 the
university comprised a college, a school of commerce, a school
of engineering and a school of law, and had a library of 47,000
volumes, 23 instructors and 565 students. In the Lee Memorial
chapel, on the campus, General Robert E. Lee is buried, and
over his grave is a notable recumbent statue of him by Edward
Virginius Valentine (b. 1838). The Virginia Military Institute
was established in March 1839, when its cadet corps supplanted
the company of soldiers maintained by the state to garrison
the Western Arsenal at Lexington. The first superintendent
(1839-1890) was General Francis Henney Smith (1812-1890),
a graduate (1833) of the United States Military Academy;
and from 1851 until the outbreak of the Civil War &ldquo;Stonewall&rdquo;
Jackson was a professor in the Institute&mdash;he is buried in the
Lexington cemetery and his grave is marked by a monument.
On the campus of the institute is a fine statue, &ldquo;Virginia
Mourning Her Dead,&rdquo; by Moses Ezekiel (b. 1844), which commemorates
the gallantry of a battalion of 250 cadets from the
institute, more than 50 of whom were killed or wounded during
the engagement at New Market on the 15th of May 1864. In
1908-1909 the institute had 21 instructors and 330 cadets.
Flour is manufactured in Lexington and lime in the vicinity.
The town owns and operates its water-works. The first settlers
of Rockbridge county established themselves in 1737 near the
North river, a short distance below Lexington. The first
permanent settlement on the present site was made about 1778.
On the 11th of June 1864, during the occupation of the town by
Federal troops under General David Hunter, most of the buildings
in the town and those of the university were damaged and all

<p><span class="bold">LEYDEN, JOHN<a name="ar60" id="ar60"></a></span> (1775-1811), British orientalist and man of
letters, was born on the 8th of September 1775 at Denholm on the
Teviot, not far from Hawick. Leyden&rsquo;s father was a shepherd,
but contrived to send his son to Edinburgh University to study
for the ministry. Leyden was a diligent but somewhat miscellaneous
student, reading everything apparently, except theology,
for which he seems to have had no taste. Though he completed
his divinity course, and in 1798 received licence to preach from
the presbytery of St Andrews, it soon became clear that the
pulpit was not his vocation. In 1794 Leyden had formed the
acquaintance of Dr Robert Anderson, editor of <i>The British Poets</i>,
and of <i>The Literary Magazine</i>. It was Anderson who introduced
him to Dr Alexander Murray, and Murray, probably, who led
him to the study of Eastern languages. They became warm
friends and generous rivals, though Leyden excelled, perhaps, in
the rapid acquisition of new tongues and acquaintance with
their literature, while Murray was the more scientific philologist.
Through Anderson also he came to know Richard Heber, by
whom he was brought under the notice of Sir Walter Scott, who
was then collecting materials for his <i>Minstrelsy of the Scottish
Border</i>. Leyden was admirably fitted for helping in this kind of
work, for he was a borderer himself, and an enthusiastic lover of
old ballads and folk-lore. Scott tells how, on one occasion,
Leyden walked 40 m. to get the last two verses of a ballad, and
returned at midnight, singing it all the way with his loud, harsh
voice, to the wonder and consternation of the poet and his
household.</p>

<p>Leyden meanwhile compiled a work on the <i>Discoveries and
Settlements of Europeans in Northern and Western Africa</i>, suggested
by Mungo Park&rsquo;s travels, edited <i>The Complaint of Scotland</i>,
printed a volume of Scottish descriptive poems, and nearly
finished his <i>Scenes of Infancy</i>, a diffuse poem based on border
scenes and traditions. He also made some translations from
Eastern poetry, Persian and Arabic. At last his friends got
him an appointment in India on the medical staff, for which he
qualified by a year&rsquo;s hard work. In 1803 he sailed for Madras,
and took his place in the general hospital there. He was promoted
to be naturalist to the commissioners going to survey
Mysore, and in 1807 his knowledge of the languages of India
procured him an appointment as professor of Hindustani at
Calcutta; this he soon after resigned for a judgeship, and that
again to be a commissioner in the court of requests in 1809, a
post which required a familiarity with several Eastern tongues.
In 1811 he joined Lord Minto in the expedition to Java. Having
entered a library which was said to contain many Eastern MSS.,
without having the place aired, he was seized with Batavian
fever, and died, after three days&rsquo; illness, on the 28th of August
1811.</p>


<div class="center ptb6"><img style="width:200px; height:36px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img000.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p><span class="bold">LEYDEN JAR,<a name="ar61" id="ar61"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Condenser</span>, an electrical appliance consisting
in one form of a thin glass jar partly coated inside and
outside with tin foil, or in another of a number of glass plates
similarly coated. When the two metal surfaces are connected
for a short time with the terminals of some source of electromotive
force, such as an electric machine, an induction coil or
a voltaic battery, electric energy is stored up in the condenser
in the form of electric strain in the glass, and can be recovered
again in the form of an electric discharge.</p>

<p>The earliest form of Leyden jar consisted of a glass vial or thin
Florence flask, partly full of water, having a metallic nail inserted
through the cork which touched the water. The
bottle was held in the hand, and the nail presented
<span class="sidenote">Early history.</span>
to the prime conductor of an electrical machine. If
the person holding the bottle subsequently touched the nail, he
experienced an electric shock. This experiment was first made
by E. G. von Kleist of Kammin in Pomerania in 1745,<a name="fa1e" id="fa1e" href="#ft1e"><span class="sp">1</span></a> and it
was repeated in another form in 1746 by Cunaeus and P. van
Musschenbroek, of the university of Leyden (Leiden), whence the
term Leyden jar.<a name="fa2e" id="fa2e" href="#ft2e"><span class="sp">2</span></a> J. H. Winkler discovered that an iron chain
wound round the bottle could be substituted for the hand, and Sir
William Watson in England shortly afterward showed that iron
filings or mercury could replace the water within the jar. Dr
John Bevis of London suggested, in 1746, the use of sheet lead
coatings within and without the jar, and subsequently the use
of tin foil or silver leaf made closely adherent to the glass.
Benjamin Franklin and Bevis devised independently the form of
condenser known as a Franklin or Leyden pane, which consists
of a sheet of glass, partly coated on both sides with tin foil or
silver leaf, a margin of glass all round being left to insulate the
two tin foils from each other. Franklin in 1747 and 1748 made
numerous investigations on the Leyden jar, and devised a method
of charging jars in series as well as in parallel. In the former
method, now commonly known as charging in <i>cascade</i>, the jars
are insulated and the outside coating of one jar is connected to
the inside coating of the next and so on for a whole series, the
inside coating of the first jar and the outside coating of the last
jar being the terminals of the condenser. For charging in
parallel a number of jars are collected in a box, and all the outside
coatings are connected together metallically and all the
inside coatings brought to one common terminal. This arrangement
is commonly called a battery of Leyden jars. To Franklin
also we owe the important knowledge that the electric charge
resides really in the glass and not in the metal coatings, and that
when a condenser has been charged the metallic coatings can
be exchanged for fresh ones and yet the electric charge of the
condenser remains.</p>

<p>In its modern form the Leyden jar consists of a wide-mouthed
bottle of thin English flint glass of uniform thickness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page529" id="page529"></a>529</span>
free from flaws. About half the outside and half the inside
surface is coated smoothly with tin foil, and the remainder of
<span class="sidenote">Modern construction.</span>
the glazed surface is painted with shellac varnish. A
wooden stopper closes the mouth of the jar, and through
it a brass rod passes which terminates in a chain, or
better still, three elastic brass springs, which make good
contact with the inner coating. The rod terminates externally
in a knob or screw terminal. The jar has a certain capacity C
which is best expressed in microfarads or electrostatic units (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Electrostatics</a></span>), and is determined by the surface of the tin
foil and thickness and quality of the glass. The jar can be
charged so that a certain potential difference V, reckoned in
volts, exists between the two coatings. If a certain critical
potential is exceeded, the glass gives way under the electric
strain and is pierced. The safe voltage for most glass jars is
about 20,000 volts for glass <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">10</span>th in. in thickness; this corresponds
with an electric spark of about 7 millimetres in length.
When the jar is charged, it is usually discharged through a
metallic arc called the discharging tongs, and this discharge is
in the form of an oscillatory current (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Electrokinetics</a></span>).
The energy stored up in the jar in joules is expressed by the value
of ½ CV<span class="sp">2</span>, where C is the capacity measured in farads and V the
potential difference of the coatings in volts. If the capacity C
is reckoned in microfarads then the energy storage is equal to
CV<span class="sp">2</span>/2 × 10<span class="sp">6</span> joules or 0.737 CV<span class="sp">2</span>/2 × 10<span class="sp">6</span> foot-pounds. The size
of jar commonly known as a quart size may have a capacity
from <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">400</span>th to <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">800</span>th of a microfarad, and if charged to 20,000
volts stores up energy from a quarter to half a joule or from
<span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">16</span>ths to <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">8</span>ths of a foot-pound.</p>

<p>Leyden jars are now much employed for the production of
the high frequency electric currents used in wireless telegraphy
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Telegraphy</a></span>, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Wireless</a></span>). For this purpose they are made
by Moscicki in the form of glass tubes partly coated by silver
chemically deposited on the glass on the inner and outer surfaces.
The tubes have walls thicker at the ends than in the middle,
as the tendency to puncture the glass is greatest at the edges of
the coatings. In other cases, Leyden jars or condensers take
the form of sheets of mica or micanite or ebonite partly coated
with tin foil or silver leaf on both sides; or a pile of sheets of
alternate tin foil and mica may be built up, the tin foil sheets
having lugs projecting out first on one side and then on the other.
All the lugs on one side are connected together, and so also are
all the lugs on the other side, and the two sets of tin foils separated
by sheets of mica constitute the two metallic surfaces of
the Leyden jar condenser. For the purposes of wireless telegraphy,
when large condensers are required, the ordinary Leyden
<span class="sidenote">High tension condensers.</span>
jar occupies too much space in comparison with its
electrical capacity, and hence the best form of condenser
consists of a number of sheets of crown glass,
each partly coated on both sides with tin foil. The
tin foil sheets have lugs attached which project beyond the glass.
The plates are placed in a vessel full of insulating oil which prevents
the glow or brush discharge taking place over their edges.
All the tin foils on one side of the glass plates are connected
together and all the tin foils on the opposite sides, so as to construct
a condenser of any required capacity. The box should
be of glass or stoneware or other non-conducting material. When
glass tubes are used it is better to employ tubes thicker at the
ends than in the middle, as it has been found that when the safe
voltage is exceeded and the glass gives way under electric strain,
the piercing of the glass nearly always takes place at the edges
of the tin foil.</p>

<p>Glass is still commonly used as a dielectric because of its
cheapness, high dielectric strength or resistance to electric
puncture, and its high dielectric constant (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Electrostatics</a></span>).
It has been found, however, that very
<span class="sidenote">Compressed air condensers.</span>
efficient condensers can be made with compressed air
as dielectric. If a number of metal plates separated by
small distance pieces are enclosed in an iron box which is pumped
full of air to a pressure, say, of 100 &#8468;. to 1 sq. in., the dielectric
strength of the air is greatly increased, and the plates may therefore
be brought very near to one another without causing a spark
to pass under such voltage as would cause discharge in air at
normal pressure. Condensers of this kind have been employed
by R. A. Fessenden in wireless telegraphy, and they form a very
excellent arrangement for standard condensers with which to
compare the capacity of other Leyden jars. Owing to the
variation in the value of the dielectric constant of glass with the
temperature and with the frequency of the applied electromotive
force, and also owing to electric glow discharge from the edges
of the tin foil coatings, the capacity of an ordinary Leyden jar
is not an absolutely fixed quantity, but its numerical value varies
somewhat with the method by which it is measured, and with
the other circumstances above mentioned. For the purpose of
a standard condenser a number of concentric metal tubes may
be arranged on an insulating stand, alternate tubes being connected
together. One coating of the condenser is formed by one
set of tubes and the other by the other set, the air between being
the dielectric. Paraffin oil or any liquid dielectric of constant
inductivity may replace the air.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEYS, HENDRIK,<a name="ar62" id="ar62"></a></span> <span class="sc">Baron</span> (1815-1869), Belgian painter, was
born at Antwerp on the 18th of February 1815. He studied
under Wappers at the Antwerp Academy. In 1833 he painted
&ldquo;Combat d&rsquo;un grenadier et d&rsquo;un cosaque,&rdquo; and in the following
year &ldquo;Combat de Bourguignons et Flamands.&rdquo; In 1835 he
went to Paris where he was influenced by the Romantic movement.
Examples of this period of his painting are &ldquo;Massacre
des échevins de Louvain,&rdquo; &ldquo;Mariage flamand,&rdquo; &ldquo;Le Roi des
arbalétriers&rdquo; and other works. Leys was an imitative painter
in whose works may rapidly be detected the schools which he had
been studying before he painted them. Thus after his visit to
Holland in 1839 he reproduced many of the characteristics of the
Dutch genre painters in such works as &ldquo;Franz Floris se rendant
à une fête&rdquo; (1845) and &ldquo;Service divin en Hollande&rdquo; (1850).
So too the methods of Quentin Matsys impressed themselves
upon him after he had travelled in Germany in 1852. In 1862
Leys was created a baron. At the time of his death, which
occurred in August 1869, he was engaged in decorating with
fresco the large hall of the Antwerp Hôtel de Ville.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LEYTON,<a name="ar63" id="ar63"></a></span> an urban district forming one of the north-eastern
suburbs of London, England, in the Walthamstow (S.W.)
parliamentary division of Essex. Pop. (1891) 63,106; (1901)
98,912. It lies on the east (left) bank of the Lea, along the flat
open valley of which runs the boundary between Essex and the
county of London. The church of St Mary, mainly a brick
reconstruction, contains several interesting memorials; including
one to William Bowyer the printer (d. 1737), erected by his son
and namesake, more famous in the same trade. Here is also
buried John Strype the historian and biographer (d. 1737),
who held the position of curate and lecturer at this church.
Leyton is in the main a residential as distinct from a manufacturing
locality. Its name is properly Low Leyton, and the parish
includes the district of Leytonstone to the east. Roman remains
have been discovered here, but no identification with a Roman
station by name has been made with certainty. The ground of
the Essex County Cricket Club is at Leyton.</p>


<div class="center ptb6"><img style="width:200px; height:36px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img000.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p><span class="bold">LHASA<a name="ar64" id="ar64"></a></span> (<span class="sc">Lhassa</span>, <span class="sc">Lassa</span>, &ldquo;God&rsquo;s ground&rdquo;), the capital of
Tibet. It lies in 29° 39&prime; N., 91° 5&prime; E., 11,830 ft. above sea-level.
Owing to the inaccessibility of Tibet and the political and religious
exclusiveness of the lamas, Lhasa was long closed to European
travellers, all of whom during the latter half of the 19th century
were stopped in their attempts to reach it. It was popularly
known as the &ldquo;Forbidden City.&rdquo; But its chief features were
known by the accounts of the earlier Romish missionaries who
visited it and by the investigations, in modern times, of native
Indian secret explorers, and others, and the British armed
mission of 1904 (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Tibet</a></span>).</p>

<p><i>Site and General Aspect.</i>&mdash;The city stands in a tolerably level
plain, which is surrounded on all sides by hills. Along its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page530" id="page530"></a>530</span>
southern side, about ½ m. south of Lhasa, runs a considerable
river called the Kyichu (Ki-chu) or Kyi, flowing here from E.N.E.,
and joining the great Tsangpo (or upper course of the Brahmaputra)
some 38 m. to the south-west. The hills round the city
are barren. The plain, however, is fertile, though in parts
marshy. There are gardens scattered over it round the city, and
these are planted with fine trees. The city is screened from view
from the west by a rocky ridge, lofty and narrow, with summits
at the north and south, the one flanked and crowned by the
majestic buildings of Potala, the chief residence of the Dalai
lama, the other by the temple of medicine. Groves, gardens
and open ground intervene between this ridge and the city itself
for a distance of about 1 m. A gate through the centre of the
ridge gives access from the west; the road thence to the north
part of the city throws off a branch to the Yutok sampa or
turquoise-tiled covered bridge, one of the noted features of
Lhasa, which crosses a former channel of the Kyi, and carries
the road to the centre of the town.</p>

<p>The city is nearly circular in form, and less than 1 m. in diameter.
It was walled in the latter part of the 17th century,
but the walls were destroyed during the Chinese occupation in
1722. The chief streets are fairly straight, but generally of no
great width. There is no paving or metal, nor any drainage
system, so that the streets are dirty and in parts often flooded.
The inferior quarters are unspeakably filthy, and are rife with
evil smells and large mangy dogs and pigs. Many of the houses
are of clay and sun-dried brick, but those of the richer people are
of stone and brick. All are frequently white-washed, the doors
and windows being framed in bands of red and yellow. In the
suburbs there are houses entirely built of the horns of sheep and
oxen set in clay mortar. This construction is in some cases very
roughly carried out, but in others it is solid and highly
picturesque. Some of the inferior huts of this type are inhabited
by the Ragyaba or scavengers, whose chief occupation is that of
disposing of corpses according to the practice of cutting and
exposing them to the dogs and birds of prey. The houses generally
are of two or three storeys. Externally the lower part
generally presents dead walls (the ground floor being occupied
by stables and similar apartments); above these rise tiers of
large windows with or without projecting balconies, and over
all flat broad-eaved roofs at varying levels. In the better houses
there are often spacious and well-finished apartments, and the
principal halls, the verandahs and terraces are often highly
ornamented in brilliant colours. In every house there is a kind
of chapel or shrine, carved and gilt, on which are set images and
sacred books.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Temples and Monasteries.</i>&mdash;In the centre of the city is an open
square which forms the chief market-place. Here is the great temple
of the &ldquo;Jo&rdquo; or Lord Buddha, called the Jokhang,<a name="fa1f" id="fa1f" href="#ft1f"><span class="sp">1</span></a>
regarded as the centre of all Tibet, from which all the main
<span class="sidenote">The Jokhang.</span>
roads are considered to radiate. This is the great metropolitan
sanctuary and church-centre of Tibet, the St Peter&rsquo;s or
Lateran of Lamaism. It is believed to have been founded by the
Tibetan Constantine, Srong-tsan-gampo, in 652, as the shrine of one
of those two very sacred Buddhist images which were associated
with his conversion and with the foundation of the civilized monarchy
in Tibet. The exterior of the building is not impressive; it rises
little above the level of other buildings which closely surround it,
and the effect of its characteristic gilt roof, though conspicuous and
striking from afar, is lost close at hand.</p>

<p>The main building of the Jokhang is three storeys high. The
entrance consists of a portico supported on timber columns, carved
and gilt, while the walls are engraved with Chinese, Mongolian and
Tibetan characters, and a great prayer-wheel stands on one side.
Massive folding doors, ornamented with scrollwork in iron, lead to
an antehall, and from this a second gate opens into a courtyard
surrounded by a verandah with many pillars and chapels, and frescoes
on its walls. On the left is the throne of the grand lama, laid with
cushions, together with the seats of other ecclesiastical dignitaries,
variously elevated according to the rank of their occupants. An
inner door with enclosed vestibule gives access to the quadrangular
choir or chancel, as it may be called, though its centre is open to
the sky. On either side of it are three chapels, and at the extremity
is the rectangular &ldquo;holy of holies,&rdquo; flanked by two gilded images
of the coming Buddha, and screened by lattice-work. In it is the
shrine on which sits the great image of Sakya, set about with small
figures, lamps and a variety of offerings, and richly jewelled, though
the workmanship of the whole is crude. In the second and third
storeys of the temple are shrines and representations of a number
of gods and goddesses. The temple contains a vast accumulation
of images, gold and silver vessels, lamps, reliquaries and precious
bric-à-brac of every kind. The daily offices are attended by crowds
of worshippers, and a sacred way which leads round the main building
is constantly traversed by devotees who perform the circuit as
a work of merit, always in a particular direction. The temple was
found by the members of the British mission who visited it to be
exceedingly dirty, and the atmosphere was foul with the fumes of
butter-lamps.</p>

<p>Besides the convent-cells, halls of study and magazines of precious
lumber, buildings grouped about the Jokhang are occupied by the
civil administration, <i>e.g.</i> as treasuries, customs office, courts of
justice, &amp;c., and there are also private apartments for the grand
lama and other high functionaries. No woman is permitted to pass
the night within the precinct.</p>

<p>In front of the main entrance to the Jokhang, in the shadow of a
sacred willow tree, stands a famous monument, the Doring monolith,
which bears the inscribed record of a treaty of peace concluded in
822 (or, according to another view, in 783) between the king of Tibet
and the emperor of China. Before this monument the apostate
from Lamaism, Langdharma, brother and successor of the last-named
king, is said to have been standing when a fanatic recluse, who had
been stirred by a vision to avenge his persecuted faith, assassinated
him.</p>

<p>The famous Potala hill, covered by the palace of the Dalai lama,
forms a majestic mountain of building; with its vast inward-sloping
walls broken only in the upper parts by straight rows of
many windows, and its flat roofs at various levels, it is
<span class="sidenote">Potala.</span>
not unlike a fortress in appearance. At the south base of the rock
is a large space enclosed by walls and gates, with great porticoes
on the inner side. This swarms with lamas and with beggars. A
series of tolerably easy staircases, broken by intervals of gentle
ascent, leads to the summit of the rock. The whole width of this is
occupied by the palace. The central part of this group of buildings
(for the component parts of Potala are of different dates) rises in a
vast quadrangular mass above its satellites to a great height, terminating
in gilt canopies similar to those on the Jokhang. Here on the
lofty terrace is the grand lama&rsquo;s promenade, and from this great
height he looks down upon the crowds of his votaries far below.
This central member of Potala is called the red palace from its
crimson colour, which distinguishes it from the rest. It contains
the principal halls and chapels and shrines of past Dalai lamas.
There is in these much rich decorative painting, with jewelled work,
carving and other ornament, but the interior of Potala as a whole
cannot compare in magnificence with the exterior. Among the
numerous other buildings of note on or near Potala hill, one is
distinguished by the Chinese as one of the principal beauties of
Lhasa. This is a temple not far from the base of the hill, in the
middle of a lake which is surrounded by trees and shrubberies.
This temple, called Lu-kang, is circular in form, with a <i>loggia</i> or
portico running all round and adorned with paintings. Its name,
&ldquo;the serpent house,&rdquo; comes from the tradition of a serpent or dragon,
which dwelt here and must be propitiated lest it should cause the
waters to rise and flood Lhasa.</p>

<p>Another great and famous temple is Ramo-ché, at the north side
of the city. This is also regarded as a foundation of Srong-tsan-gampo,
and is said to contain the body of his Chinese wife and the
second of the primeval palladia, the image that she brought with
her to the Snow-land; whence it is known as the &ldquo;small Jokhang.&rdquo;
This temple is noted for the practice of magical arts. Its buildings
are in a neglected condition.</p>

<p>Another monastery within the city is that of Moru, also on the
north side, remarkable for its external order and cleanliness. Though
famous as a school of orthodox magic, it is noted also for the printing-house
in the convent garden. This convent was the temporary
residence of the regent during the visit of the British mission in
1904. Other monasteries in or near the city are the Tsamo Ling or
Chomoling at the north-west corner; the Tangyä Ling or Tengyeling
at the west of the city; the Kundä Ling or Kundeling about 1 m.
west of the city, at the foot of a low isolated hill called Chapochi.
Three miles south, beyond the river, is the Tsemchog Ling or Tsecholing.
These four convents are known as &ldquo;The Four Ling.&rdquo; From
their inmates the Dalai lama&rsquo;s regent, during his minority, was
formerly chosen. The temple of medicine, as already stated, crowns
the summit (Chagpa) at the end of the ridge west of the city, opposite
to that on which stands the Potala. It is natural that in a country
possessing a religious system like that of Tibet the medical profession
should form a branch of the priesthood. &ldquo;The treatment of disease,
though based in some measure upon a judicious use of the commoner
simple drugs of the country, is, as was inevitable amongst so superstitious
a people, saturated with absurdity&rdquo; (Waddell, <i>Lhasa and its
Mysteries</i>).</p>

<p>The three great monasteries in the vicinity of Lhasa, all claiming
to be foundations of Tsongkhapa (1356-1418), the medieval reformer
and organizer of the modern orthodox Lama Church, &ldquo;the yellow
caps,&rdquo; are the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <i>Debung</i> (written &rsquo;<i>Bras spungs</i>) is 6 m. west of Lhasa at the foot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page531" id="page531"></a>531</span>
of the hills which flank the plain on the north. It is one of the
largest monasteries in the world, having some 8000 monks. In the
middle of the convent buildings rises a kind of pavilion, brilliant with
colour and gilding, which is occupied by the Dalai Lama when he
visits Debung once a year and expounds to the inmates. The place
is frequented by the Mongol students who come to Lhasa to graduate,
and is known in the country as the Mongol convent; it has also
been notorious as a centre of political intrigue. Near it is the seat
of the chief magician of Tibet, the Nachung Chos-kyong, a building
picturesque in itself and in situation.</p>

<p>2. <i>Sera</i> is 3 m. north of the city on the acclivity of the hills and
close to the road by which pilgrims enter from Mongolia. From a
distance the crowd of buildings and temples, rising in amphitheatre
against a background of rocky mountains, forms a pleasing picture.
In the recesses of the hill, high above the convent, are scattered
cells of lamas adopting the solitary life. The chief temple of Sera,
a highly ornate building, has a special reputation as the resting-place
of a famous <i>Dorj&#275;</i>, <i>i.e.</i> the <i>Vajra</i> or Thunderbolt of Jupiter,
the symbol of the strong and indestructible, which the priest grasps
and manipulates in various ways during prayer. The emblem is a
bronze instrument, shaped much like a dumbbell with pointed ends,
and it is carried solemnly in procession to the Jokhang during the
New Year&rsquo;s festival.</p>

<p>The hill adjoining Sera is believed to be rich in silver ore, but it
is not allowed to be worked. On the summit is a spring and a holy
place of the Lhasa Mahommedans, who resort thither. Near the
monastery there is said to be gold, which is worked by the monks.
&ldquo;Should they ... discover a nugget of large size, it is immediately
replaced in the earth, under the impression that the large nuggets
... germinate in time, producing the small lumps which they are
privileged to search for&rdquo; (Nain Singh).</p>

<p>3. <i>Galdan.</i>&mdash;This great convent is some 25 m. east of Lhasa, on
the other side of the Kyichu. It is the oldest monastery of the
&ldquo;Yellow&rdquo; sect, having been founded by Tsongkhapa and having
had him for its first superior. Here his body is said to be preserved
with miraculous circumstances; here is his tomb, of marble and
malachite, with a great shrine said to be of gold, and here are other
relics of him, such as the impression of his hands and feet.</p>

<p><i>Samyé</i> is another famous convent intimately connected with Lhasa,
being said to be used as a treasury by the government, but it lies
some 36 m. south-east on the left bank of the great Tsangpo. It
was founded in 770, and is the oldest extant monastery in Tibet.
It is surrounded by a very high circular stone wall, 1½ m. in circumference,
with gates facing the four points of the compass. On this
wall Nain Singh, who was here on his journey in 1874, counted
1030 votive piles of brick. One very large temple occupies the
centre, and round it are four smaller but still large temples. Many
of the idols are said to be of pure gold, and the wealth is very great.
The interiors of the temples are covered with beautiful writing in
enormous characters, which the vulgar believe to be the writing of
Sakya himself.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Population and Trade.</i>&mdash;The total population of Lhasa,
including the lamas in the city and vicinity, is probably about
30,000; a census in 1854 made the figure 42,000, but it is known
to have greatly decreased since. There are only some 1500
resident Tibetan laymen and about 5500 Tibetan women. The
permanent population embraces, besides Tibetans, settled
families of Chinese (about 2000 persons), as well as people from
Nepal, from Ladak, and a few from Bhotan and Mongolia. The
Ladakis and some of the other foreigners are Mahommedans,
and much of the trade is in their hands. Desideri (1716) speaks
also of Armenians and even &ldquo;Muscovites.&rdquo; The Chinese have
a crowded burial-ground at Lhasa, tended carefully after their
manner. The Nepalese (about 800) supply the mechanics and
metal-workers. There are among them excellent gold- and
silversmiths; and they make the elaborate gilded canopies
crowning the temples. The chief industries are the weaving
of a great variety of stuffs from the fine Tibetan wool; the
making of earthenware and of the wooden porringers (varying
immensely in elaboration and price) of which every Tibetan
carries one about with him; also the making of certain fragrant
sticks of incense much valued in China and elsewhere.</p>

<p>As Lhasa is not only the nucleus of a cluster of vast monastic
establishments, which attract students and aspirants to the
religious life from all parts of Tibet and Mongolia, but is also
a great place of pilgrimage, the streets and public places swarm
with visitors from every part of the Himalayan plateau,<a name="fa2f" id="fa2f" href="#ft2f"><span class="sp">2</span></a> and
from all the steppes of Asia between Manchuria and the Balkhash
Lake. Naturally a great traffic arises quite apart from the
pilgrimage. The city thus swarms with crowds attracted by
devotion and the love of gain, and presents a great diversity of
language, costume and physiognomy; though, in regard to the
last point, varieties of the broad face and narrow eye greatly
predominate. Much of the retail trade of the place is in the
hands of the women. The curious practice of the women in
plastering their faces with a dark-coloured pigment is less common
in Lhasa than in the provinces.</p>

<p>During December especially traders arrive from western
China by way of Tachienlu bringing every variety of silk-stuffs,
carpets, china-ware and tea; from Siningfu come silk, gold lace,
Russian goods, carpets of a superior kind, semi-precious stones,
horse furniture, horses and a very large breed of fat-tailed sheep;
from eastern Tibet, musk in large quantities, which eventually
finds its way to Europe through Nepal; from Bhotan and
Sikkim, rice; from Sikkim also tobacco; besides a variety
of Indian and European goods from Nepal and Darjeeling, and
<i>charas</i> (resinous exudation of hemp) and saffron from Ladakh
and Kashmir. The merchants leave Lhasa in March, before
the setting in of the rains renders the rivers impassable.</p>

<p>The tea importation from China is considerable, for tea is an
absolute necessary to the Tibetan. The tea is of various qualities,
from the coarsest, used only for &ldquo;buttered&rdquo; tea (a sort of broth),
to the fine quality drunk by the wealthy. This is pressed into
bricks or cakes weighing about 5½ &#8468;, and often passes as currency.
The quantity that pays duty at Tachienlu is about 10,000,000 &#8468;,
besides some amount smuggled. No doubt a large part of this
comes to Lhasa.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Lhasa Festivities.</i>&mdash;The greatest of these is at the new year. This
lasts fifteen days, and is a kind of lamaic carnival, in which masks
and mummings, wherein the Tibetans take especial delight, play a
great part. The celebration commences at midnight, with shouts
and clangour of bells, gongs, chank-shells, drums and all the noisy
repertory of Tibetan music; whilst friends exchange early visits
and administer coarse sweetmeats and buttered tea. On the second
day the Dalai Lama gives a grand banquet, at which the Chinese
and native authorities are present, whilst in the public spaces and in
front of the great convents all sorts of shows and jugglers&rsquo; performances
go on. Next day a regular Tibetan exhibition takes place.
A long cable, twisted of leather thongs, is stretched from a high point
in the battlements of Potala slanting down to the plain, where it is
strongly moored. Two men slide from top to bottom of this huge
hypothenuse, sometimes lying on the chest (which is protected by a
breast-plate of strong leather), spreading their arms as if to swim,
and descending with the rapidity of an arrow-flight. Occasionally
fatal accidents occur in this performance, which is called &ldquo;the dance
of the gods&rdquo;; but the survivors are rewarded by the court, and the
Grand Lama himself is always a witness of it. This practice occurs
more or less over the Himalayan plateau, and is known in the neighbourhood
of the Ganges as <i>Barat</i>. It is employed as a kind of
expiatory rite in cases of pestilence and the like. Exactly the same
performance is described as having been exhibited in St Paul&rsquo;s Churchyard
before King Edward VI., and again before Philip of Spain,
as well as, about 1750, at Hertford and other places in England (see
Strutt&rsquo;s <i>Sports</i>, &amp;c., 2nd ed., p. 198).</p>

<p>The most remarkable celebration of the new year&rsquo;s festivities is
the great jubilee of the <i>Monlam</i> (<i>s Mon-lam</i>, &ldquo;prayer&rdquo;), instituted
by Tsongkhapa himself in 1408. Lamas from all parts of Tibet, but
chiefly from the great convents in the neighbourhood, flock to Lhasa,
and every road leading thither is thronged with troops of monks on
foot or horseback, on yaks or donkeys, carrying with them their
breviaries and their cooking-pots. Those who cannot find lodging
bivouac in the streets and squares, or pitch their little black tents
in the plain. The festival lasts six days, during which there reigns
a kind of saturnalia. Unspeakable confusion and disorder reign,
while gangs of lamas parade the streets, shouting, singing and coming
to blows. The object of this gathering is, however, supposed to be
devotional. Vast processions take place, with mystic offerings and
lama-music, to the Jokhang and Moru convents; the Grand Lama
himself assists at the festival, and from an elevated throne beside
the Jokhang receives the offerings of the multitude and bestows his
benediction.</p>

<p>On the 15th of the first month multitudes of torches are kept
ablaze, which lighten up the city to a great distance, whilst the
interior of the Jokhang is illuminated throughout the night by innumerable
lanterns shedding light on coloured figures in bas-relief,
framed in arabesques of animals, birds and flowers, and representing
the history of Buddha and other subjects, all modelled in butter.
The figures are executed on a large scale, and, as described by Huc,
who witnessed the festival at Kunbum on the frontier of China,
with extraordinary truth and skill. These singular works of art
occupy some months in preparation, and on the morrow are thrown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page532" id="page532"></a>532</span>
away. On other days horse-races take place from Sera to Potala,
and foot-races from Potala to the city. On the 27th of the month
the holy <i>Dorj&#275;</i> is carried in solemn procession from Sera to the
Jokhang, and to the presence of the lama at Potala.</p>

<p>Of other great annual feasts, one, in the fourth month, is assigned
to the conception of Sakya, but appears to connect itself with the
old nature-feast of the entering of spring, and to be more or less
identical with the <i>H&#363;l&#299;</i> of India. A second, the consecration of the
waters, in September-October, appears, on the confines of India,
to be associated with the Dasehra.</p>

<p>On the 30th day of the second month there takes place a strange
ceremony, akin to that of the scapegoat (which is not unknown in
India). It is called the driving out of the demon. A man is hired to
perform the part of demon (or victim rather), a part which sometimes
ends fatally. He is fantastically dressed, his face mottled with white
and black, and is then brought forth from the Jokhang to engage in
quasi-theological controversy with one who represents the Grand
Lama. This ends in their throwing dice against each other (as it
were for the weal or woe of Lhasa). If the demon were to win the
omen would be appalling; so this is effectually barred by false dice.
The victim is then marched outside the city, followed by the troops
and by the whole populace, hooting, shouting and firing volleys after
him. Once he is driven off, the people return, and he is carried off
to the Samyé convent. Should he die shortly after, this is auspicious;
if not, he is kept in ward at Samyé for a twelvemonth.</p>

<p>Nain Singh, whose habitual accuracy is attested by many facts,
mentions a strange practice of comparatively recent origin, according
to which the civil power in the city is put up to auction for the first
twenty-three days of the new year. The purchaser, who must be a
member of the Debung monastery, and is termed the <i>Jalno</i>, is a kind
of lord of misrule, who exercises arbitrary authority during that time
for his own benefit, levying taxes and capricious fines upon the
citizens.</p>
</div>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;The seat of the princes whose family raised Tibet
to a position among the powers of Asia was originally on the
Yarlung river, in the extreme east of the region now occupied
by Tibetan tribes. It was transplanted to Lhasa in the 7th
century by the king Srong-tsan-gampo, conqueror, civilizer
and proselytizer, the founder of Buddhism in Tibet, the introducer
of the Indian alphabet. On the three-peaked crag now
occupied by the palace-monastery of the Grand Lama this king
is said to have established his fortress, while he founded in the
plain below temples to receive the sacred images, brought
respectively from Nepal and from China by the brides to whom
his own conversion is attributed.</p>

<p>Tibet endured as a conquering power some two centuries,
and the more famous among the descendants of the founder
added to the city. This-rong-de-tsan (who reigned 740-786) is
said to have erected a great temple-palace of which the basement
followed the Tibetan style, the middle storey the Chinese, and the
upper storey the Indian&mdash;a combination which would aptly
symbolize the elements that have moulded the culture of Lhasa.
His son, the last of the great orthodox kings, in the next century,
is said to have summoned artists from Nepal and India, and
among many splendid foundations to have erected a sanctuary
(at Samyé) of vast height, which had nine storeys, the three lower
of stone, the three middle of brick, the three uppermost of
timber. With this king the glory of Tibet and of ancient Lhasa
reached its zenith, and in 822, a monument recording his treaty
on equal terms with the Great T&rsquo;ang emperor of China was
erected in the city. There followed dark days for Lhasa and the
Buddhist church in the accession of this king&rsquo;s brother Langdharma,
who has been called the Julian of the lamas. This
king rejected the doctrine, persecuted and scattered its ministers,
and threw down its temples, convents and images. It was more
than a century before Buddhism recovered its hold and its
convents were rehabilitated over Tibet. The country was
then split into an infinity of petty states, many of them ruled
from the convents by warlike ecclesiastics; but, though the old
monarchy never recovered, Lhasa seems to have maintained
some supremacy, and probably never lost its claim to be the chief
city of that congeries of principalities, with a common faith
and a common language, which was called Tibet.</p>

<p>The Arab geographers of the 10th century speak of Tibet,
but without real knowledge, and none speaks of any city that
we can identify with Lhasa. The first passage in any Western
author in which such identification can be probably traced
occurs in the narrative of Friar Odoric of Pordenone (<i>c.</i> 1330).
This remarkable traveller&rsquo;s route from Europe to India, and
thence by sea to China, can be traced satisfactorily, but of his
journey homeward through Asia the indications are very fragmentary.
He speaks, however, on this return journey of the
realm of Tibet, which lay on the confines of India proper:
&ldquo;The folk of that country dwell in tents made of black felt.
But the chief and royal city is all built with walls of black and
white, and all its streets are very well paved. In this city no
one shall dare to shed the blood of any, whether man or beast,
for the reverence they bear a certain idol that is there worshipped.
In that city dwelleth the <i>Abassi</i>, <i>i.e.</i> in their tongue the pope,
who is the head of all the idolaters, and has the disposal of all
their benefices such as they are after their manner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We know that Kublai Khan had constituted a young prince of
the Lama Church, Mati Dhwaja, as head of that body, and
tributary ruler of Tibet, but besides this all is obscure for a
century. This passage of Odoric shows that such authority
continued under Kublai&rsquo;s descendants, and that some foreshadow
of the position since occupied by the Dalai Lama already existed.
But it was not till a century after Odoric that the strange
heredity of the dynasty of the Dalai Lamas of Lhasa actually
began. In the first two centuries of its existence the residence
of these pontiffs was rather at Debung or Sera than at Lhasa
itself, though the latter was the centre of devout resort. A
great event for Lhasa was the conversion, or reconversion,
of the Mongols to Lamaism (<i>c.</i> 1577), which made the city the
focus of sanctity and pilgrimage to so vast a tract of Asia. It
was in the middle of the 17th century that Lhasa became the
residence of the Dalai Lama. A native prince, known as the
Tsangpo, with his seat at Shigatse, had made himself master
of southern Tibet, and threatened to absorb the whole. The
fifth Dalai Lama, Nagwang Lobzang, called in the aid of a
Kalmuck prince, Gushi Khan, from the neighbourhood of the
Koko-nor, who defeated and slew the Tsangpo and made over
full dominion in Tibet to the lama (1641). The latter now
first established his court and built his palace on the rock-site
of the fortress of the ancient monarchy, which apparently
had fallen into ruin, and to this he gave the name of Potala.</p>

<p>The founder of Potala died in 1681. He had appointed as
&ldquo;regent&rdquo; or civil administrator (<i>Deisri</i>, or <i>Deba</i>) one supposed
to be his own natural son. This remarkable personage, Sangye
Gyamtso, of great ambition and accomplishment, still renowned
in Tibet as the author of some of the most valued works of the
native literature, concealed the death of his master, asserting
that the latter had retired, in mystic meditation or trance, to
the upper chambers of the palace. The government continued
to be carried on in the lama&rsquo;s name by the regent, who leagued
with Galdan Khan of Dzungaria against the Chinese (Manchu)
power. It was not till the great emperor Kang-hi was marching
on Tibet that the death of the lama, sixteen years before, was
admitted. A solemn funeral was then performed, at which
108,000 lamas assisted, and a new incarnation was set up in the
person of a youth of fifteen, Tsangs-yang Gyamtso. This young
man was the scandal of the Lamaist Church in every kind of
evil living and debauchery, so that he was deposed and assassinated
in 1701. But it was under him and the regent Sangye
Gyamtso that the Potala palace attained its present scale of
grandeur, and that most of the other great buildings of Lhasa
were extended and embellished.</p>

<p><span class="bold">L&rsquo;HÔPITAL<a name="ar65" id="ar65"></a></span> (or <span class="sc">L&rsquo;Hospital</span>), <span class="bold">MICHEL DE</span> (<i>c.</i> 1505-1573),
French statesman, was born near Aigueperse in Auvergne (now
Puy-de-Dôme). His father, who was physician to the constable
Charles of Bourbon, sent him to study at Toulouse, whence
at the age of eighteen he was driven, a consequence of the evil
fortunes of the family patron, to Padua, where he studied law
and letters for about six years. On the completion of his studies
he joined his father at Bologna, and afterwards, the constable
having died, went to Rome in the suite of Charles V. For some
time he held a position in the papal court at Rome, but about
1534 he returned to France, and becoming an advocate, his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page533" id="page533"></a>533</span>
marriage, in 1537, procured for him the post of counsellor to the
parlement of Paris. This office he held until 1547, when he was
sent by Henry II. on a mission to Bologna, where the council
of Trent was at that time sitting; after sixteen months of
wearisome inactivity there, he was by his own desire recalled
at the close of 1548. L&rsquo;Hôpital now for some time held the
position of chancellor to the king&rsquo;s sister, Margaret, duchess
of Berry. In 1553, on the recommendation of the Cardinal of
Lorraine, he was named master of the requests, and afterwards
president of the chambre des comptes. In 1559 he accompanied
the princess Margaret, now duchess of Savoy, to Nice, where,
in the following year, tidings reached him that he had been
chosen to succeed François Olivier (1487-1560) in the chancellorship
of France.</p>

<p>One of his first acts after entering on the duties of his office
was to cause the parlement of Paris to register the edict of
Romorantin, of which he is sometimes, but erroneously, said to
have been the author. Designed to protect heretics from the
secret and summary methods of the Inquisition, it certainly had
his sympathy and approval. In accordance with the consistent
policy of inclusion and toleration by which the whole of his
official life was characterized, he induced the council to call the
assembly of notables, which met at Fontainebleau in August 1560
and agreed that the States General should be summoned, all
proceedings against heretics being meanwhile suppressed, pending
the reformation of the church by a general or national council.
The States General met in December; the edict of Orleans
(January 1561) followed, and finally, after the colloquy of Poissy,
the edict of January 1562, the most liberal, except that of Nantes,
ever obtained by the Protestants of France. Its terms, however,
were not carried out, and during the war which was the inevitable
result of the massacre of Vassy in March, L&rsquo;Hôpital, whose
dismissal had been for some time urged by the papal legate
Hippolytus of Este, found it necessary to retire to his estate
at Vignay, near Étampes, whence he did not return until after
the pacification of Amboise (March 19, 1563). It was by his
advice that Charles IX. was declared of age at Rouen in August
1563, a measure which really increased the power Of Catherine
de&rsquo; Medici; and it was under his influence also that the royal
council in 1564 refused to authorize the publication of the acts
of the council of Trent, on account of their inconsistency with
the Gallican liberties. In 1564-1566 he accompanied the young
king on an extended tour through France; and in 1566 he was
instrumental in the promulgation of an important edict for the
reform of abuses in the administration of justice. The renewal
of the religious war in September 1567, however, was at once
a symptom and a cause of diminished influence to L&rsquo;Hôpital,
and in February 1568 he obtained his letters of discharge, which
were registered by the parlement on the 11th of May, his titles,
honours and emoluments being reserved to him during the remainder
of his life. Henceforward he lived a life of unbroken
seclusion at Vignay, his only subsequent public appearance
being by means of a <i>mémoire</i> which he addressed to the king in
1570 under the title <i>Le But de la guerre et de la paix, ou discours
du chancelier l&rsquo;Hospital pour exhorter Charles IX. à donner la
paix à ses sujets</i>. Though not exempt from considerable danger,
he passed in safety through the troubles of St Bartholomew&rsquo;s eve.
His death took place either at Vignay or at Bellébat on the 13th
of March 1573.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>After his death Pibrac, assisted by De Thou and Scévole de
Sainte-Marthe, collected a volume of the <i>Poemata</i> of L&rsquo;Hôpital,
and in 1585 his grandson published <i>Epistolarum seu Sermonum
libri sex</i>. The complete <i>&OElig;uvres de l&rsquo;Hôpital</i> were published for the
first time by P. J. S. Dufey (5 vols., Paris, 1824-1825). They include
his &ldquo;Harangues&rdquo; and &ldquo;Remonstrances,&rdquo; the <i>Epistles</i>, the <i>Mémoire</i>

<p><span class="bold">LIAO-YANG,<a name="ar66" id="ar66"></a></span> a city of China, formerly the chief town of the
province of Liao-tung or Shêng-king (southern Manchuria),
35 m. S of Mukden. It is situated in a rich cotton district in
the fertile valley of the Liao, on the road between Niuchwang
and Mukden, and carries on a considerable trade. The walls
include an area about 2½ m. long by 2 m. broad, and there are
fairly extensive suburbs; but a good deal even of the enclosed
area is under cultivation. The population is estimated at 100,000.
Liao-yang was one of the first objectives of the Japanese during
the Russo-Japanese War, and its capture by them resulted
in some of the fiercest fighting during the campaign, from the
24th of August to the 4th of September 1904.</p>


<div class="center ptb6"><img style="width:200px; height:36px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img000.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p><span class="bold">LIAS,<a name="ar67" id="ar67"></a></span> in geology, the lowermost group of Jurassic strata.
Originally the name seems to have been written &ldquo;Lyas&rdquo;; it is
most probably a provincial form of &ldquo;layers,&rdquo; strata, employed
by quarrymen in the west of England; it has been suggested,
however, that the Fr. <i>liais</i>, Breton <i>leach</i> = a stone, Gaelic <i>leac</i> =
flat stone, may have given rise to the English &ldquo;Lias.&rdquo; Liassic
strata occupy an important position in England, where they crop
out at Lyme Regis on the Dorsetshire coast and extend thence
by Bath, along the western flank of the Cotswold Hills, forming
Edge Hill and appearing at Banbury, Rugby, Melton, Grantham,
Lincoln, to Redcar on the coast of Yorkshire. They occur also
in Glamorganshire, Shropshire, near Carlisle, in Skye, Raasay
(Pabba, Scalpa and Broadfoot beds), and elsewhere in the north
of Scotland, and in the north-east of Ireland. East of the belt of
outcrop indicated, the Lias is known to occur beneath the younger
rocks for some distance farther east, but it is absent from beneath
London, Reading, Ware, Harwich, Dover, and in the southern
portion of the area in which these towns lie; the Liassic rocks
are probably thinned out against a concealed ridge of more ancient
rocks. The table on following page will serve to illustrate the
general characters of the English Lias and the subdivisions adopted
by the Geological Survey. By the side are shown the principal
zonal ammonites, and, for comparison, the subdivisions preferred
by Messrs Tate and Blake and by A. de Lapparent.</p>

<p>The important fact is clearly demonstrated in the table, that
where the Lias is seen in contact with the Trias below or the
Inferior Oolite above, there is, as a rule, a gradual passage from
the Liassic formation, both downwards and upwards; hence
Professor de Lapparent includes in his <i>Liassique System</i> the
zone of <i>Ammonites opalinus</i> at the top, and the Rhaetic beds
at the bottom (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Oolite</a></span>; <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Rhaetic</a></span>). Owing to the transgression
of the Liassic sea the strata rest in places upon older
Palaeozoic rocks. The thickness of the Lias varies considerably;
in Dorsetshire it is 900 ft., near Bath it has thinned to 280 ft.,
and beneath Oxford it is further reduced. In north Gloucestershire
it is 1360 ft., Northampton 760 ft., Rutland 800 ft., Lincolnshire
950 ft., and in Yorkshire about 500 ft.</p>

<p>The Lias of England was laid down in conditions very similar
to those which obtained at the same time in north France and
north Germany, that is to say, on the floor of a shallow sea; but
in the Alpine region limestones are developed upon a much greater
scale. Many of the limestones are red and crystalline marbles
such as the &ldquo;ammonitico-rosso-inferiore&rdquo; of the Apennines;
a grey, laminated limestone is known as the &ldquo;Fleckenmergel.&rdquo;
The whitish &ldquo;Hierlatzkalke,&rdquo; the Adnet beds and the &ldquo;Grestener
beds&rdquo; in the eastern Alps and Balkan Mountains are important
phases of Alpine Lias. The Grestener beds contain a considerable
amount of coal. The Lias of Spain and the Pyrenees contains
much dolomitic limestone. This formation is widely spread in
western Europe; besides the localities already cited it occurs in
Swabia, the Rhenish provinces, Alsace-Lorraine, Luxemburg,
Ardennes, Normandy, Austria-Hungary, the Balkan States,
Greece and Scania. It has not been found north of Kharkov
in Russia, but it is present in the south and in the Caucasus, in
Anatolia, Persia and the Himalayas. It appears on the eastern
side of Japan, in Borneo, Timor, New Caledonia and New
Zealand (Bastion beds); in Algeria, Tunisia and elsewhere in
North Africa, and on the west coast of Madagascar. In South
America it is found in the Bolivian Andes, in Chile and Argentina;
it appears also on the Pacific coast of North America.</p>

<p>The economic products of the Lias are of considerable importance.
In the Lower Lias of Lincolnshire and the Middle Lias of Oxfordshire,
Northamptonshire, Lincolnshire, Leicestershire and Yorkshire the
beds of ironstone are of great value. Most of these ores are limestones
that have been converted into iron carbonate with some admixture
of silicates; they weather near the surface into hydrated peroxide.
At Frodingham in Lincolnshire the oolitic iron ore reaches 30 ft. in
thickness, of which 12 ft. are workable. In Gloucestershire the top
beds of the Lower Lias and lower beds of the Middle division are the
most ferruginous; the best ores near Woodstock and Banbury
and between Market Harborough and Leicester are at the summit
of the Middle Lias in the Marlstone or Rock bed. The ironstone of
Fawler is sometimes known as Blenheim ore. The ores of the Cleveland
district in Yorkshire have a great reputation; the main seam is
11 ft. thick at Eston, where it rests directly upon the Pecten Seam,
the two together aggregating 15 ft. 6 in. Similar iron ores of this age
are worked at Meurthe-et-Moselle, Villerupt, Marbache, Longuy,
Champagneulles, &amp;c. Some of the Liassic limestones are used as
building stones, the more important ones being the Lower Lias
Sutton stone of Glamorganshire and Middle Lias Hornton stone, the
best of the Lias building stones, from Edge Hill. The limestones are
often used for paving. The limestones of the Lower Lias are much
used for the production of hydraulic cement and &ldquo;Blue Lias&rdquo; lime
at Rugby, Barrow-on-Soar, Barnstone, Lyme Regis, Abertham
and many other places. Roman cement has been made from the
nodules in the Upper Lias of Yorkshire; alum is obtained from the
same horizon. A considerable trade was formerly done in jet, the
best quality being obtained from the &ldquo;Serpentinus&rdquo; beds, but
&ldquo;bastard&rdquo; or soft jet is found in many of the other strata in the
Yorkshire Lias. Both Lower and Upper Lias clays have been used
in making bricks and tiles.</p>

<p>Fossils are abundant in the Lias; Lyme Regis, Shepton Mallet,
Rugby, Robin Hood&rsquo;s Bay, Ilminster, Whitby and Golden Cap near
Charmouth are well-known localities. The saurian reptiles, <i>Ichthyosaurus</i>
and <i>Plesiosaurus</i>, are found in excellent preservation along
with the Pterodactyl. Among the fishes are <i>Hybodus</i>, <i>Dapedius</i>,
<i>Pholidophorus</i>, <i>Acrodus</i>. The crinoids, <i>Pentacrinus</i> and <i>Extracrinus</i>
are locally abundant. Insect remains are very abundant in certain
beds. Many ammonites occur in this formation in addition to the
forms used as zonal indexes mentioned in the table. <i>Lima gigantea</i>,
<i>Posidonomya Bronni</i>, <i>Inoceramus dubius</i>, <i>Gryphaea cymbium</i> and
<i>G. arcuata</i> are common pelecypods. <i>Amberleya capitanea</i>, <i>Pleurotomaria
anglica</i> are Lias gasteropods. <i>Leptaena</i>, <i>Spiriferina</i>, <i>Terebratella</i>
and <i>Rhynchonella tetrahedra</i> and <i>R. variabilis</i> are among the
brachiopods.</p>

<p>Certain dark limestones with regular bedding which occur in the
Carboniferous System are sometimes called &ldquo;Black Lias&rdquo; by
quarrymen.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIBANIUS<a name="ar68" id="ar68"></a></span> (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 314-393), Greek sophist and rhetorician,
was born at Antioch, the capital of Syria. He studied at Athens,
and spent most of his earlier manhood in Constantinople and
Nicomedia. His private classes at Constantinople were much
more popular than those of the public professors, who had him
expelled in 346 (or earlier) on the charge of studying magic.
He removed his school to Nicomedia, where he remained five
years. After another attempt to settle in Constantinople, he
finally retired to Antioch (354). Though a pagan, he enjoyed
the favour of the Christian emperors. When Julian, his special
patron, restored paganism as the state religion, Libanius showed
no intolerance. Among his pupils he numbered John Chrysostom,
Basil (bishop of Caesarea) and Ammianus Marcellinus.
His works, consisting chiefly of orations (including his autobiography),
declamations on set topics, letters, life of Demosthenes,
and arguments to all his orations are voluminous. He devoted
much time to the classical Greek writers, and had a thorough
contempt for Rome and all things Roman. His speeches and
letters throw considerable light on the political and literary
history of the age. The letters number 1607 in the Greek
original; with these were formerly included some 400 in Latin,
purporting to be a translation, but now proved to be a forgery
by the Italian humanist F. Zambeccari (15th century).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIBAU<a name="ar70" id="ar70"></a></span> (Lettish, <i>Leepaya</i>), a seaport of Russia, in the government
of Courland, 145 m. by rail S.W. of Riga, at the northern
extremity of a narrow sandy peninsula which separates Lake
Libau (12 m. long and 2 m. wide) from the Baltic Sea. Its
population has more than doubled since 1881 (30,000), being
64,505 in 1897. The town is well built of stone, with good
gardens, and has a naval cathedral (1903). The harbour was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page535" id="page535"></a>535</span>
2 m. S. of the town until a canal was dug through the peninsula
in 1697; it is now deepened to 23 ft., and is mostly free from
ice throughout the year. Since being brought, in 1872, into
railway connexion with Moscow, Orel and Kharkov, Libau has
become an important port. New Libau possesses large factories
for colours, explosives, machinery belts, sails and ropes, tobacco,
furniture, matches, as well as iron works, agricultural machinery
works, tin-plate works, soap works, saw-mills, breweries, oil-mills,
cork and linoleum factories and flour-mills. The exports
reach the annual value of £3,250,000 to £5,500,000, oats being
the chief export, with flour, wheat, rye, butter, eggs, spirits,
flax, linseed, oilcake, pork, timber, horses and petroleum. The
imports average £1,500,000 to £2,000,000 annually. Shipbuilding,
including steamers for open-sea navigation, is on the increase.
North of the commercial harbour and enclosing it the Russian
government made (1893-1906) a very extensive fortified naval
port, protected by moles and breakwaters. Libau is visited for
sea-bathing in summer.</p>

<p>The port of Libau, <i>Lyra portus</i>, is mentioned as early as 1263;
it then belonged to the Livonian Order or Brothers of the Sword.
In 1418 it was burnt by the Lithuanians, and in 1560 it was
mortgaged by the grandmaster of the Teutonic Order, to which
it had passed, to the Prussian duke Albert. In 1701 it was
captured by Charles XII. of Sweden, and was annexed to Russia
in 1795.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIBEL<a name="ar71" id="ar71"></a></span> and <span class="bold">SLANDER,</span> the terms employed in English law
to denote injurious attacks upon a man&rsquo;s reputation or character
by words written or spoken, or by equivalent signs. In most
early systems of law verbal injuries are treated as a criminal or
quasi-criminal offence, the essence of the injury lying not in
pecuniary loss, which may be compensated by damages, but in
the personal insult which must be atoned for&mdash;a vindictive
penalty coming in the place of personal revenge. By the law
of the XII. Tables, the composition of scurrilous songs and
gross noisy public affronts were punished by death. Minor
offences of the same class seem to have found their place under
the general conception of <i>injuria</i>, which included ultimately
every form of direct personal aggression which involved contumely
or insult. In the later Roman jurisprudence, which has,
on this point, exercised considerable influence over modern
systems of law, verbal injuries are dealt with in the edict under
two heads. The first comprehended defamatory and injurious
statements made in a public manner (<i>convicium contra bonos
mores</i>). In this case the essence of the offence lay in the unwarrantable
public proclamation. In such a case the truth of
the statements was no justification for the unnecessarily public
and insulting manner in which they had been made. The second
head included defamatory statements made in private, and in
this case the offence lay in the imputation itself, not in the
manner of its publication. The truth was therefore a sufficient
defence, for no man had a right to demand legal protection for
a false reputation. Even belief in the truth was enough, because
it took away the intention which was essential to the notion of
<i>injuria</i>. The law thus aimed at giving sufficient scope for the
discussion of a man&rsquo;s character, while it protected him from
needless insult and pain. The remedy for verbal injuries was
long confined to a civil action for a money penalty, which was
estimated according to the gravity of the case, and which,
although vindictive in its character, doubtless included practically
the element of compensation. But a new remedy was
introduced with the extension of the criminal law, under which
many kinds of defamation were punished with great severity.
At the same time increased importance attached to the publication
of defamatory books and writings, the <i>libri</i> or <i>libelli famosi</i>,
from which we derive our modern use of the word libel; and
under the later emperors the latter term came to be specially
applied to anonymous accusations or pasquils, the dissemination
of which was regarded as peculiarly dangerous, and visited with
very severe punishment, whether the matter contained in them
were true or false.</p>

<p>The earlier history of the English law of defamation is somewhat
obscure. Civil actions for damages seem to have been
tolerably frequent so far back as the reign of Edward I. There
was no distinction drawn between words written and spoken.
When no pecuniary penalty was involved such cases fell within
the old jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical courts, which was only
finally abolished in the 19th century. It seems, to say the least,
uncertain whether any generally applicable criminal process
was in use. The crime of <i>scandalum magnatum</i>, spreading false
reports about the magnates of the realm, was established by
statutes, but the first fully reported case in which libel is affirmed
generally to be punishable at common law is one tried in the
star chamber in the reign of James I. In that case no English
authorities are cited except a previous case of the same nature
before the same tribunal; the law and terminology appear to
be taken directly from Roman sources, with the insertion that
libels tended to a breach of the peace; and it seems probable
that that not very scrupulous tribunal had simply found it
convenient to adopt the very stringent Roman provisions regarding
the <i>libelli famosi</i> without paying any regard to the Roman
limitations. From that time we find both the criminal and civil
remedies in full operation, and the law with regard to each at
the present time may now be considered.</p>

<p><i>Civil Law.</i>&mdash;The first important distinction encountered is
that between slander and libel, between the oral and written
promulgation of defamatory statements. In the former case the
remedy is limited. The law will not take notice of every kind
of abusive or defamatory language. It must be shown either
that the plaintiff has suffered actual damage as a direct consequence
of the slander, or that the imputation is of such a nature
that we are entitled to infer damage as a necessary consequence.
The special damage on which an action is founded for slanderous
words must be of the nature of pecuniary loss. Loss of reputation
or of position in society, or even illness, however clearly it
may be traced to the slander, is insufficient. When we cannot
prove special damage, the action for slander is only allowed upon
certain strictly defined grounds. These are the imputation of a
crime or misdemeanour which is punishable corporeally, <i>e.g.</i>
by imprisonment; the imputation of a contagious or infectious
disease; statements which tend to the disherison of an apparent
heir (other cases of slander of title when the party is in possession
requiring the allegation of special damage); the accusing a
woman of unchastity (Slander of Women Act 1891); and, lastly,
slanders directed against a man&rsquo;s professional or business
character, which tend directly to prejudice him in his trade,
profession, or means of livelihood. In the latter case the words
must either be directly aimed at a man in his business or official
character, or they must be such as necessarily to imply unfitness
for his particular office or occupation. Thus words which merely
reflect generally upon the moral character of a tradesman or
professional man are not actionable, but they are actionable
if directed against his dealings in the course of his trade or
profession. But, in the case of a merchant or trader, an allegation
which affects his credit generally is enough, and it has been
held that statements are actionable which affect the ability
or moral characters of persons who hold offices, or exercise
occupation which require a high degree of ability, or infer peculiar
confidence. In every case the plaintiff must have been at the time
of the slander in the actual exercise of the occupation or enjoyment
of the office with reference to which the slander is supposed
to have affected him.</p>

<p>The action for libel is not restricted in the same way as that for
slander. Originally there appears to have been no essential
distinction between them, but the establishment of libel as a
criminal offence had probably considerable influence, and it soon
became settled that written defamatory statements, or pictures
and other signs which bore a defamatory meaning, implied
greater malice and deliberation, and were generally fraught
with greater injury than those made by word of mouth. The
result has been that the action for libel is not limited to special
grounds, or by the necessity of proving special damage. It may
be founded on any statement which disparages a man&rsquo;s private
or professional character, or which tends to hold him up to hatred,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page536" id="page536"></a>536</span>
contempt or ridicule. In one of the leading cases, for example,
the plaintiff obtained damages because it was said of him that
he was a hypocrite, and had used the cloak of religion for unworthy
purposes. In another case a charge of ingratitude
was held sufficient. In civil cases the libel must be published
by being brought by the defendant under the notice of a third
party; it has been held that it is sufficient if this has been done
by gross carelessness, without deliberate intention to publish.
Every person is liable to an action who is concerned in the
publication of a libel, whether he be the author, printer or
publisher; and the extent and manner of the publication,
although not affecting the ground of the action, is a material
element in estimating the damages.</p>

<p>It is not necessary that the defamatory character of the words
or writing complained of should be apparent on their face. They
may be couched in the form of an insinuation, or may derive
their sting from a reference to circumstances understood by the
persons to whom they are addressed. In such a case the plaintiff
must make the injurious sense clear by an averment called an
innuendo, and it is for the jury to say whether the words bore
the meaning thus ascribed to them.</p>

<p>In all civil actions for slander and libel the falsity of the
injurious statements is an essential element, so that the defendant
is always entitled to justify his statements by their truth; but
when the statements are in themselves defamatory, their falsity
is presumed, and the burden of proving their truth is laid upon
the defendant. There are however a large class of false
defamatory statements, commonly called privileged, which are
not actionable on account of the particular circumstances in which
they are made. The general theory of law with regard to these
cases is this. It is assumed that in every case of defamation
intention is a necessary element; but in the ordinary case,
when a statement is false and defamatory, the law presumes
that it has been made or published with an evil intent, and will
not allow this presumption to be rebutted by evidence or submitted
as matter of fact to a jury. But there are certain circumstances
in which the natural presumption is quite the other
way. There are certain natural and proper occasions on which
statements may be made which are in themselves defamatory,
and which may be false, but which naturally suggest that the
statements may have been made from a perfectly proper motive
and with entire belief in their truth. In the cases of this kind
which are recognized by law, the presumption is reversed.
It lies with the plaintiff to show that the defendant was actuated
by what is called <i>express malice</i>, by an intention to do harm,
and in this case the question is not one of legal inference for the
court, but a matter of fact to be decided by the jury. Although,
however, the theory of the law seems to rest entirely upon natural
presumption of intention, it is pretty clear that in determining
the limits of privilege the courts have been almost wholly guided
by considerations of public or general expediency.</p>

<p>In some cases the privilege is absolute, so that we cannot have
an action for defamation even although we prove express malice.
Thus no action of this kind can be maintained for statements
made in judicial proceedings if they are in any sense relevant
to the matter in hand. In the same way no statements or
publications are actionable which are made in the ordinary course
of parliamentary proceedings. Papers published under the
authority of parliament are protected by a special act, 3 &amp; 4 Vict.
c. 9, 1840, which was passed after a decree of the law courts
adverse to the privilege claimed. The reports of judicial and
parliamentary proceedings stand in a somewhat different
position, which has only been attained after a long and interesting
conflict. The general rule now is that all reports of parliamentary
or judicial proceedings are privileged in so far as they are honest
and impartial. Even <i>ex parte</i> proceedings, in so far as they take
place in public, now fall within the same rule. But if the report
is garbled, or if part of it only is published, the party who is
injured in consequence is entitled to maintain an action, and to
have the question of malice submitted to a jury.</p>

<p>Both absolute and qualified privilege are given to newspaper
reports under certain conditions by the Law of Libel Amendment
Act 1888. The reports must, however, be published in a newspaper
as defined in the Newspaper Libel and Registration Act
1881. Under this act a newspaper must be published &ldquo;at
intervals not exceeding twenty-six days.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>By s. 3 of the act of 1888 fair and accurate reports of judicial proceedings
are absolutely privileged provided that the report is published
contemporaneously with the proceedings and no blasphemous
or indecent matter is contained therein. By s. 4 a limited privilege
is given to fair and accurate reports (1) of the proceedings of a <i>bona
fide</i> public meeting lawfully held for a lawful purpose and for the
furtherance and discussion of any matter of public concern, even
when the admission thereto is restricted; (2) of any meeting, open
either to the public or to a reporter, of a vestry, town council, school
board, board of guardians, board of local authority, formed or
constituted under the provisions of any act of parliament, or of any
committee appointed by any of these bodies; or of any meeting of
any commissioners authorized to act by letters patent, act of parliament,
warrant under royal sign manual, or other lawful warrant or
authority, select committees of either House of parliament, justices
of the peace in quarter sessions assembled for administrative or
deliberative purposes; (3) of the publication of any notice or report
issued for the information of the public by any government office
or department, officer of state, commissioner of police or chief
constable, and published at their request. But the privilege given
in s. 4 does not authorize the publication of any blasphemous or
indecent matter; nor is the protection available as a defence if it be
proved that the reports or notices were published maliciously, in the
legal sense of the word, or the defendant has been requested to insert
in the newspaper in which the report was issued a reasonable letter
or statement by way of contradiction or explanation, and has refused
or neglected to do so. Moreover, nothing in s. 4 is to interfere with
any privilege then existing, or to protect the publication of any
matter not of public concern, or in cases where publication is not
for the public benefit. Consequently no criminal prosecution should
be commenced where the interests of the public are not affected.
By the Law of Libel Amendment Act 1888, s. 8, no criminal prosecution
for libel is to be commenced against any newspaper proprietor,
publisher or editor unless the order of a judge at chambers has been
first obtained. This protection does not cover the actual writer of
the alleged libel.</p>
</div>

<p>In private life a large number of statements are privileged so
long as they remain matters of strictly private communication.
It is difficult to define the limits of private privilege without
extensive reference to concrete cases; but generally it may be
said that it includes all communications made in performance
of a duty not merely legal but moral or social, answers to <i>bona
fide</i> inquiries, communications made by persons in confidential
relations regarding matters in which one or both are interested,
and even statements made within proper limits by persons in
the <i>bona fide</i> prosecution of their own interest. Common examples
of this kind of privilege are to be found in answer to
inquiries as to the character of servants or the solvency of a
trader, warnings to a friend, communications between persons
who are jointly interested in some matters of business. But
in every case care must be taken not to exceed the limits of
publication required by the occasion, or otherwise the privilege
is lost. Thus defamatory statements may be privileged when
made to a meeting of shareholders, but not when published to
others who have no immediate concern in the business.</p>

<p>In a few instances in which an action cannot be maintained
even by the averment of malice, the plaintiff may maintain an
action by averring not only malice but also want of reasonable
and probable cause. The most common instances of this kind
are malicious charges made in the ordinary course of justice and
malicious prosecutions. In such cases it would be contrary to
public policy to punish or prevent every charge which was made
from a purely malicious motive, but there is no reason for protecting
accusations which are not only malicious, but destitute
of all reasonable probability.</p>

<p><i>Criminal Law.</i>&mdash;Publications which are blasphemous, immoral
or seditious are frequently termed libels, and are punishable
both at common law and by various statutes. The matter,
however, which constitutes the offence in these publications lies
beyond our present scope. Libels upon individuals may be
prosecuted by criminal information or indictment, but there can
be no criminal prosecution for slander. So far as concerns the
definition of libel, and its limitation by the necessity of proving
in certain cases express malice, there is no substantial difference
between the rules which apply to criminal prosecutions and to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page537" id="page537"></a>537</span>
civil actions, with the one important exception (now considerably
modified) that the falsity of a libel is not in criminal law an
essential element of the offence. If the matter alleged were in
itself defamatory, the court would not permit inquiry into its
truth. The sweeping application of this rule seems chiefly due
to the indiscriminate use, in earlier cases, of a rule in Roman law
which was only applicable to certain modes of publication, but
has been supported by various reasons of general policy, and
especially by the view that one main reason for punishing a
libel was its tendency to provoke a breach of the peace.</p>

<p>An important dispute about the powers of the jury in cases
of libel arose during the 19th century in connexion with some
well-known trials for seditious libels. The point is familiar
to readers of Macaulay in connexion with the trial of the seven
bishops, but the cases in which it was brought most prominently
forward, and which led to its final settlement, were those against
Woodfall (the printer of <i>Junius</i>), Wilkes and others, and especially
the case against Shipley, the dean of St Asaph (21 St. Tr.
925), in which the question was fought by Lord Erskine with
extraordinary energy and ability. The controversy turned upon
the question whether the jury were to be strictly confined to
matters of fact which required to be proved by evidence, or
whether in every case they were entitled to form their own
opinion upon the libellous character of the publication and
the intention of the author. The jury, if they pleased, had it
in their power to return a general verdict of guilty or not guilty,
but both in theory and practice they were subject in law to the
directions of the court, and had to be informed by it as to what
they were to take into consideration in determining upon their
verdict. There is no difficulty about the general application of
this principle in criminal trials. If the crime is one which is
inferred by law from certain facts, the jury are only concerned
with these facts, and must accept the construction put upon
them by law. Applying these principles to the case of libel,
juries were directed that it was for the court to determine
whether the publication fell within the definition of libel, and
whether the case was one in which malice was to be inferred by
construction of law. If the case were one in which malice was
inferred by law, the only facts left to the jury were the fact of
publication and the meaning averred by innuendoes; they could
not go into the question of intention, unless the case were one
of privilege, in which express malice had to be proved. In
general principle, therefore, the decisions of the court were in
accordance with the ordinary principles of criminal law. But
there were undoubtedly some peculiarities in the case of libel.
The sense of words, the inferences to be drawn from them, and
the effect which they produce are not so easily defined as gross
matters of fact. They seem to belong to those cases in which
the impression made upon a jury is more to be trusted than the
decision of a judge. Further, owing to the mode of procedure,
the defendant was often punished before the question of law
was determined. But, nevertheless, the question would scarcely
have been raised had the libels related merely to private matters.
The real ground of dispute was the liberty to be accorded to
political discussion. Had the judges taken as wide a view of
privilege in discussing matters of public interest as they do now,
the question could scarcely have arisen; for Erskine&rsquo;s whole
contention really amounted to this, that the jury were entitled
to take into consideration the good or bad intent of the authors,
which is precisely the question which would now be put before
them in any matter which concerned the public. But at that
time the notion of a special privilege attaching to political discussion
had scarcely arisen, or was confined within very narrow
limits, and the cause of free political discussion seemed to be
more safely entrusted to juries than to courts. The question was
finally settled by the Libel Act 1792, by which the jury were
entitled to give a general verdict on the whole matter put in issue.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Scots Law.</i>&mdash;In Scots law there were originally three remedies
for defamation. It might be prosecuted by or with the concurrence
of the lord advocate before the court of justiciary; or, secondly, a
criminal remedy might be obtained in the commissary (ecclesiastical)
courts, which originally dealt with the defender by public retractation
or penance, but subsequently made use of fines payable to their own
procurator or to the party injured, these latter being regarded as
solatium to his feelings; or, lastly, an action of damages was competent
before the court of session, which was strictly civil in its
character and aimed at the reparation of patrimonial loss. The first
remedy has fallen into disuse; the second and third (the commissary
courts being now abolished) are represented by the present action
for damages or solatium. Originally the action before the court of
session was strictly for damages&mdash;founded, not upon the <i>animus
injuriandi</i>, but upon culpa, and could be defended by proving the
truth of the statements. But in time the court of session began to
assume the original jurisdiction of the commissary courts, and entertained
actions for solatium in which the <i>animus injuriandi</i> was a
necessary element, and to which, as in Roman law, the truth was not
necessarily a defence. Ultimately the two actions got very much
confused. We find continual disputes as to the necessity for the
<i>animus injuriandi</i> and the applicability of the plea of <i>veritas convicii</i>,
which arose from the fact that the courts were not always conscious
that they were dealing with two actions, to one of which these notions
were applicable, and to the other not. On the introduction of the
jury court, presided over by an English lawyer, it was quite natural
that he, finding no very clear distinction maintained between damage
and solatium, applied the English plea of truth as a justification
to every case, and retained the <i>animus injuriandi</i> both in ordinary
cases and cases of privilege in the same shape as the English conception
of malice. The leading and almost only differences between
the English and Scots law now are that the latter makes no essential
distinction between oral and written defamation, that it practically
gives an action for every case of defamation, oral or written, upon
which in England a civil action might be maintained for libel, and
that it possesses no criminal remedy. In consequence of the latter
defect and the indiscriminate application of the plea of veritas to
every case both of damages and solatium, there appears to be no
remedy in Scotland even for the widest and most needless publication
of offensive statements if only they are true.</p>

<p><i>American Law.</i>&mdash;American law scarcely if at all differs from that of
England. In so far indeed as the common law is concerned, they may
be said to be substantially identical. The principal statutes which
have altered the English criminal law are represented by equivalent
legislation in most American states.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIBELLATICI,<a name="ar72" id="ar72"></a></span> the name given to a class of persons who,
during the persecution of Decius, <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 250, evaded the consequences
of their Christian belief by procuring documents
(<i>libelli</i>) which certified that they had satisfied the authorities
of their submission to the edict requiring them to offer incense
or sacrifice to the imperial gods. As thirty-eight years had
elapsed since the last period of persecution, the churches had
become in many ways lax, and the number of those who failed
to hold out under the persecution was very great. The procedure
of the courts which had cognizance of the matter was, however,
by no means strict, and the judges and subordinate officials
were often not ill-disposed towards Christians, so that evasion
was fairly easy. Many of those who could not hold out were
able to secure certificates which gave them immunity from
punishment without actually renouncing the faith, just as
&ldquo;parliamentary certificates&rdquo; of conformity used to be given
in England without any pretext of fact. It is to the persons who
received such certificates that the name <i>libellatici</i> belonged
(those who actually fulfilled the edict being called <i>thurificati</i>
or <i>sacrificati</i>). To calculate their number would be impossible,
but we know from the writings of Cyprian, Dionysius of Alexandria
and other contemporaries, that they were a numerous
class, and that they were to be found in Italy, in Egypt and in
Africa, and among both clergy and laity. Archbishop Benson
is probably right in thinking that &ldquo;there was no systematic
and regular procedure in the matter,&rdquo; and that the <i>libelli</i> may
have been of very different kinds. They must, however, as a
general rule, have consisted of a certificate <i>from the authorities</i>
to the effect that the accused person had satisfied them. [The
name <i>libellus</i> has also been applied to another kind of document&mdash;to
the letters given by confessors, or by those who were about
to suffer martyrdom, to persons who had fallen, to be used to
secure forgiveness for them from the authorities of the Church.
With such <i>libelli</i> we are not here concerned.] The subject has
acquired a fresh interest from the fact that two of these actual
<i>libelli</i> have been recovered, in 1893 and 1894 respectively, both
from Egypt; one is now in the Brugsch Pasha collection in the
Berlin Museum; the other is in the collection of papyri belonging
to the Archduke Rainer. The former is on a papyrus leaf about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page538" id="page538"></a>538</span>
8 by 3 in., the latter on mere fragments of papyrus which have
been pieced together. The former was first deciphered and
described by Dr Fritz Krebs, the latter by Dr K. Wessely:
both are given and commented upon by Dr Benson. There is a
remarkable similarity between them: in each the form is that N.
&ldquo;was ever constant in sacrificing to the gods&rdquo;; and that he now, in
the presence of the commissioners of the sacrifices (<span class="grk" title="hoi hêrêmenoi tôn
thysôn">&#959;&#7985; &#7969;&#961;&#951;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#953; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#952;&#965;&#963;&#8182;&#957;</span>), has both sacrificed and drunk [<i>or</i> has poured libations],
and has tasted of the victims, in witness whereof he begs them to
sign this certificate. Then follows the signature, with attestations.
The former of the two is dated, and the date must fall
in the year 250. It is impossible to prove that either of the
documents actually refers to Christians: they may have been
given to pagans who had been accused and had cleared themselves,
or to former Christians who had apostatized. But no
doubt <i>libelli</i> in this same form were delivered, in Egypt at least,
to Christians who secured immunity without actual apostasy;
and the form in Italy and Africa probably did not differ widely
from this. The practice gave rise to complicated problems of
ecclesiastical discipline, which are reflected in the correspondence
of Cyprian and especially in the Novatian controversy.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIBER<a name="ar73" id="ar73"></a></span> and <span class="bold">LIBERA,</span> in Roman mythology, deities, male
and female, identified with the Greek Dionysus and Persephone.
In honour of Liber (also called Liber Pater and Bacchus) two
festivals were celebrated. In the country feast of the vintage,
held at the time of the gathering of the grapes, and the city
festival of March 17th called <i>Liberalia</i> (Ovid, <i>Fasti</i>, iii. 711)
we find purely Italian ceremonial unaffected by Greek religion.
The country festival was a great merry-making, where the first-fruits
of the new must were offered to the gods. It was characterized
by the grossest symbolism, in honour of the fertility of
nature. In the city festival, growing civilization had impressed
a new character on the primitive religion, and connected it with
the framework of society. At this time the youths laid aside
the boy&rsquo;s <i>toga praetexta</i> and assumed the man&rsquo;s <i>toga libera</i> or
<i>virilis</i> (<i>Fasti</i>, iii. 771). Cakes of meal, honey and oil were
offered to the two deities at this festival. Liber was originally
an old Italian god of the productivity of nature, especially of the
vine. His name indicated the free, unrestrained character of his
worship. When, at an early period, the Hellenic religion of
Demeter spread to Rome, Liber and Libera were identified
with Dionysus and Persephone, and associated with another
Italian goddess Ceres, who was identified with Demeter. By
order of the Sibylline books, a temple was built to these three
deities near the Circus Flaminius; the whole cultus was borrowed
from the Greeks, down even to the terminology, and priestesses
were brought from the Greek cities.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIBERAL PARTY,<a name="ar74" id="ar74"></a></span> in Great Britain, the name given to and
accepted by the successors of the old Whig party (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Whig and
Tory</a></span>), representing the political party opposed to Toryism or
Conservatism, and claiming to be the originators and champions
of political reform and progressive legislation. The term came
into general use definitely as the name of one of the two great
parties in the state when Mr Gladstone became its leader, but
before this it had already become current coin, as a political
appellation, through a natural association with the use of such
phrases as &ldquo;liberal ideas,&rdquo; in the sense of &ldquo;favourable to
change,&rdquo; or &ldquo;in support of political freedom and democracy.&rdquo;
In this respect it was the outcome of the French Revolution,
and in the early years of the 19th century the term was used
in a French form; thus Southey in 1816 wrote about the &ldquo;British
<i>Liberales</i>.&rdquo; But the Reform Act and the work of Bentham and
Mill resulted in the crystallization of the term. In Leigh Hunt&rsquo;s
autobiography (1850) we read of &ldquo;newer and more thorough-going
Whigs ... known by the name of Radicals ... since
called Liberals&rdquo;; and J. S. Mill in 1865 wrote (from his own
Liberal point of view), &ldquo;A Liberal is he who looks forward for
his principles of government; a Tory looks backward.&rdquo; The
gradual adoption of the term for one of the great parties, superseding
&ldquo;Whig,&rdquo; was helped by the transition period of &ldquo;Liberal
Conservatism,&rdquo; describing the position of the later Peelites;
and Mr Gladstone&rsquo;s own career is the best instance of its changing
signification; moreover the adjective &ldquo;liberal&rdquo; came meanwhile
into common use in other spheres than that of parliamentary
politics, <i>e.g.</i> in religion, as meaning &ldquo;intellectually advanced&rdquo;
and free from the trammels of tradition. Broadly speaking,
the Liberal party stands for progressive legislation in accordance
with freedom of social development and advanced ethical ideas.
It claims to represent government by the people, by means of
trust in the people, in a sense which denies genuine popular
sympathy to its opponents. Being largely composed of dissenters,
it has identified itself with opposition to the vested
interests of the Church of England; and, being apt to be thwarted
by the House of Lords, with attempts to override the veto of that
house. Its old watchword, &ldquo;Peace, retrenchment and reform,&rdquo;
indicated its tendency to avoidance of a &ldquo;spirited&rdquo; foreign
policy, and to parsimony in expenditure. But throughout its
career the Liberal party has always been pushed forward by its
extreme Radical wing, and economy in the spending of public
money is no longer cherished by those who chiefly represent
the non-taxpaying classes. The party organization lends itself
to the influence of new forces. In 1861 a central organization
was started in the &ldquo;Liberal Registration Association,&rdquo; composed
&ldquo;of gentlemen of known Liberal opinions&rdquo;; and a number of
&ldquo;Liberal Associations&rdquo; soon rose throughout the country. Of
these, that at Birmingham became, under Mr J. Chamberlain
and his active supporter Mr Schnadhorst, particularly active
in the &rsquo;seventies; and it was due to Mr Schnadhorst that in
1877 a conference was held at Birmingham which resulted in the
formation of the &ldquo;National Federation of Liberal Associations,&rdquo;
or &ldquo;National Liberal Federation,&rdquo; representing a system of
organization which was dubbed by Lord Beaconsfield &ldquo;the
Caucus.&rdquo; The Birmingham Caucus and the Central Liberal
Association thus coexisted, the first as an independent democratic
institution, the second as the official body representing the whips
of the party, the first more advanced and &ldquo;Radical,&rdquo; the second
inclined to Whiggishness. Friction naturally resulted, but the
1880 elections confirmed the success of the Caucus and consolidated
its power. And in spite of the Home Rule crisis in 1886,
resulting in the splitting off of the Liberal Unionists&mdash;&ldquo;dissentient
Liberals,&rdquo; as Mr Gladstone called them&mdash;from the
Liberal party, the organization of the National Liberal Federation
remained, in the dark days of the party, its main support.
Its headquarters were, however, removed to London, and under
Mr Schnadhorst it was practically amalgamated with the old
Central Association.</p>

<p>It is impossible here to write in detail the later history of the
Liberal party, but the salient facts will be found in such articles
as those on Mr Gladstone, Mr J. Chamberlain, Lord Rosebery,
Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, Mr H. H. Asquith and Mr
David Lloyd George.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIBER DIURNUS ROMANORUM PONTIFICUM,<a name="ar75" id="ar75"></a></span> or &ldquo;Journal
of the Roman Pontiffs,&rdquo; the name given to a collection of formulae
used in the papal chancellery in preparing official documents,
such as the installation of a pope, the bestowal of the pallium
and the grant of papal privileges. It was compiled between
685 and 751, and was constantly employed until the 11th
century, when, owing to the changed circumstances of the
Church, it fell into disuse, and was soon forgotten and lost.
During the 17th century a manuscript of the <i>Liber</i> was discovered
in Rome by the humanist, Lucas Holstenius, who prepared
an edition for publication; for politic reasons, however,
the papal authorities would not allow this to appear, as the book
asserted the superiority of a general council over the pope. It
was, however, published in France by the Jesuit, Jean Garnier,
in 1680, and other editions quickly followed.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The best modern editions are one by Eugène de Rozière (Paris,
1869) and another by T. E. von Sichel (Vienna, 1889), both of which
contain critical introductions. The two existing manuscripts of the
<i>Liber</i> are in the Vatican library, Rome, and in the library of St
Ambrose at Milan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page539" id="page539"></a>539</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">LIBERIA,<a name="ar76" id="ar76"></a></span> a negro republic in West Africa, extending along
the coast of northern Guinea about 300 m., between the British
colony of Sierra Leone on the N.W. and the French colony of the
Ivory Coast on the S.E. The westernmost point of Liberia (at
the mouth of the river Mano) lies in about 6° 55&prime; N. and 11°
32&prime; W. The southernmost point of Liberia, and at the same time
almost its most eastern extension, is at the mouth of the Cavalla,
beyond Cape Palmas, only 4° 22&prime; N. of the equator, and in about
7° 33&prime; W. The width of Liberia inland varies very considerably;
it is greatest, about 200 m., from N.E. to S.W. The Liberia-Sierra
Leone boundary was determined by a frontier commission in
1903. Commencing at the mouth of the river Mano, it follows
the Mano up stream till that river cuts 10° 40&prime; W. It then
followed this line of longitude to its intersection with N. latitude
9° 6&prime;, but by the Franco-Liberian understanding of 1907 the
frontier on this side was withdrawn to 8° 25&prime; N., where the river
Makona crosses 10° 40&rsquo; W. The Liberian frontier with the
adjacent French possessions was defined by the Franco-Liberian
treaty of 1892, but as the definition therein given was found
to be very difficult of reconciliation with geographical features
(for in 1892 the whole of the Liberian interior was unmapped)
further negotiations were set on foot. In 1905 Liberia proposed
to France that the boundary line should follow the river Moa
from the British frontier of Sierra Leone up stream to near the
source of the Moa (or Makona), and that from this point the
boundary should run eastwards along the line of water-parting
between the system of the Niger on the north and that of the
coast rivers (Moa, Lofa, St Paul&rsquo;s) on the south, until the 8th
degree of N. latitude was reached, thence following this 8th
degree eastwards to where it cuts the head stream of the Cavalla
river. From this point the boundary between France and Liberia
would be the course of the Cavalla river from near its source to
the sea. Within the limits above described Liberia would
possess a total area of about 43,000 to 45,000 sq. m. But after
deliberation and as the result of certain &ldquo;frontier incidents&rdquo;
France modified her counter-proposals in 1907, and the actual
definition of the northern and eastern frontiers of Liberia is
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Starting from the point on the frontier of the British colony of
Sierra Leone where the river Moa or Makona crosses that frontier,
the Franco-Liberian frontier shall follow the left bank of the river
Makona up stream to a point 5 kilometres to the south of the town of
Bofosso. From this point the frontier shall leave the line of the
Makona and be carried in a south-easterly direction to the source of
the most north-westerly affluent of the Nuon river or Western
Cavalla. This line shall be so drawn as to leave on the French side
of the boundary the following towns: Kutumai, Kisi Kurumai,
Sundibú, Zuapa, Nzibila, Koiama, Bangwedu and Lola. From the
north-westernmost source of the Nuon the boundary shall follow
the right bank of the said Nuon river down stream to its presumed
confluence with the Cavalla, and thenceforward the right bank of the
river Cavalla down to the sea. If the ultimate destination of the
Nuon is not the Cavalla river, then the boundary shall follow the
right bank of the Nuon down stream as far as the town of Tuleplan.
A line shall then be drawn from the southern outskirts of the town
of Tuleplan due E. to the Cavalla river, and thence shall follow the
right bank of the Cavalla river to the sea.</p>

<p>(The delimitation commission proved that the Nuon does not flow
into the Cavalla, but about 6° 30&prime; N. it flows very near the north-westernmost
bend of that river. Tuleplan is in about lat. 6° 50&prime; N.
The river Makona takes a much more northerly course than had been
estimated. The river Nuon also is situated 20 or 30 m. farther to
the east than had been supposed. Consequently the territory of
Liberia as thus demarcated is rather larger than it would appear
on the uncorrected English maps of 1907&mdash;about 41,000 sq. m.)</p>
</div>

<p>It is at the southern extremity of Liberia, Cape Palmas, that
the West African coast from Morocco to the southernmost
extremity of Guinea turns somewhat abruptly eastwards and
northwards and faces the Gulf of Guinea. As the whole coastline
of Liberia thus fronts the sea route from Europe to South Africa
it is always likely to possess a certain degree of strategical
importance. The coast, however, is unprovided with a single
good harbour. The anchorage at Monrovia is safe, and with
some expenditure of money a smooth harbour could be made in
front of Grand Basa.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Coast Features.</i>&mdash;The coast is a good deal indented, almost all the
headlands projecting from north-east to south-west. A good deal
of the seaboard is dangerous by reason of the sharp rocks which lie
near the surface. As most of the rivers have rapids or falls actually
at the sea coast or close to it, they are, with the exception of the
Cavalla, useless for penetrating far inland, and the whole of this
part of Africa from Cape Palmas north-west to the Senegal suggests
a sunken land. In all probability the western projection of Africa
was connected by a land bridge with the opposite land of Brazil
as late as the Eocene period of the Tertiary epoch. The Liberian
coast has few lagoons compared with the adjoining littoral of Sierra
Leone or that of the Ivory Coast. The coast, in fact, rises in some
places rather abruptly from the sea. Cape Mount (on the northern
side of which is a large lagoon&mdash;Fisherman Lake) at its highest point
is 1050 ft. above sea level. Cape Mesurado is about 350 ft., Cape
Palmas about 200 ft. above the sea. There is a salt lake or lagoon
between the Cape Palmas river and the vicinity of the Cavalla.
Although very little of the coast belt is actually swampy, a kind of
natural canalization connects many of the rivers at their mouths
with each other, though some of these connecting creeks are as yet
unmarked on maps.</p>

<p><i>Mountains.</i>&mdash;Although there are patches of marsh&mdash;generally the
swampy bottoms of valleys&mdash;the whole surface of Liberia inclines
to be hilly or even mountainous at a short distance inland from the
coast. In the north-east, French explorers have computed the altitudes
of some mountains at figures which would make them the
highest land surfaces of the western projection of Africa&mdash;from 6000
to 9000 ft. But these altitudes are largely matters of conjecture.
The same mountains have been sighted by English explorers coming
up from the south and are pronounced to be &ldquo;very high.&rdquo; It is
possible that they may reach to 6000 ft. in some places. Between the
western bend of the Cavalla river and the coast there is a somewhat
broken mountain range with altitudes of from 2000 to 5000 ft.
(approximate). The P&#333; range to the west of the St Paul&rsquo;s river may
reach in places to 3000 ft.</p>

<p><i>Rivers.</i>&mdash;The work of the Franco-Liberian delimitation commission
in 1908-1909 cleared up many points connected with the hydrography
of the country. Notably it traced the upper Cavalla, proving
that that river was not connected either with the Nuon on the west
or the Ko or Zo on the east. The upper river and the left bank of
the lower river of the Cavalla are in French territory. It rises in
about 7° 50&prime; N., 8° 30&prime; W. in the Nimba mountains, where also rise
the Nuon, St John&rsquo;s and Dukwia rivers. After flowing S.E. the
Cavalla, between 7° and 6° N., under the name of Dugu, makes a
very considerable elbow to the west, thereafter resuming its south-easterly
course. It is navigable from the sea for some 80 m. from its
mouth and after a long series of rapids is again navigable. Unfortunately
the Cavalla does not afford a means of easy penetration
into the rich hinterland of Liberia on account of the bad bar at its
mouth. The Nuon (or Nipwe), which up to 1908 was described sometimes
as the western Cavalla and sometimes as the upper course of
the St John&rsquo;s river, has been shown to be the upper course of the
Cestos. About 6° 30&prime; N. it approaches within 16 m. of the Cavalla.
It rises in the Nimba mountains some 10 m. S. of the source of the
Cavalla, and like all the Liberian rivers (except the Cavalla) it has a
general S.W. flow. The St Paul, though inferior to the Cavalla in
length, is a large river with a considerable volume of water. The
main branch rises in the Beila country nearly as far north as 9° N.
under the name of Diani. Between 8° and 7° N. it is joined by the
Wé from the west and the Walé from the east. The important river
Lofa flows nearly parallel with the St Paul&rsquo;s river and enters the sea
about 40 m. to the west, under the name of Little Cape Mount river.
The Mano or Bewa river rises in the dense Gora forest, but is of no
great importance until it becomes the frontier between Liberia and
Sierra Leone. The Dukwia and Farmington are tortuous rivers
entering the sea under the name of the river Junk (Portuguese,
<i>Junco</i>). The Farmington is a short stream, but the Dukwia is
believed to be the lower course of the Mani, which rises as the Tigney
(Tige), north of the source of the Cavalla, just south of 8° N. The
St John&rsquo;s river of the Basa country appears to be of considerable
importance and volume. The Sino river rises in the Niete mountains
and brings down a great volume of water to the sea, though it is
not a river of considerable length. The Duobe rises at the back of
the Satro Mountains and flows nearly parallel with the Cavalla,
which it joins. The Moa or Makona river is a fine stream of considerable
volume, but its course is perpetually interrupted by
rocks and rapids. Its lower course is through the territory of Sierra
Leone, and it enters the sea as the Sulima.</p>

<p><i>Climate and Rainfall.</i>&mdash;Liberia is almost everywhere well watered.
The climate and rainfall over the whole of the coast region for about
120 m. inland are equatorial, the rainfall in the western half of the
country being about 150 in. per annum and in the eastern half
about 100 in. North of a distance of about 120 m. inland the climate
is not quite so rainy, and the weather is much cooler during the dry
season. This region beyond the hundred-miles coast belt is far more
agreeable and healthy to Europeans.</p>

<p><i>Forests.</i>&mdash;Outside a coast belt of about 20 m. and south of 8° N.
the country is one vast forest, except where the natives have cleared
the land for cultivation. In many districts the land has been cleared
and cultivated and then abandoned, and has relapsed into scrub
and jungle which is gradually returning to the condition of forest.
The densest forest of all would seem to be that known as Gora,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page540" id="page540"></a>540</span>
which is almost entirely uninhabited and occupies an area of about
6000 sq. m. between the P&#333; hills and the British frontier. There is
another very dense forest stretching with little interruption from the
eastern side of the St Paul&rsquo;s river nearly to the Cavalla. The Nidi
forest is noteworthy for its magnificent growth of <i>Funtumia</i> rubber
trees. It extends between the Duobe and the Cavalla rivers. The
extreme north of Liberia is still for the most part a very well-watered
country, covered with a rich vegetation, but there are said to be a
few breaks that are rather stony and that have a very well-marked
dry season in which the vegetation is a good deal burnt up. In the
main Liberia is the forest country par excellence of West Africa,
and although this region of dense forests overlaps the political
frontiers of both Sierra Leone and the Ivory Coast, it is a feature of
physical geography so nearly coincident with the actual frontiers
of Liberia as to give this country special characteristics clearly
marked in its existing fauna.</p>

<p><i>Fauna.</i>&mdash;The fauna of Liberia is sufficiently peculiar, at any rate
as regards vertebrates, to make it very nearly identical with a
&ldquo;district&rdquo; or sub-province of the West African province, though
in this case the Liberian &ldquo;district&rdquo; would not include the northern-most
portions of the country and would overlap on the east and west
into Sierra Leone and the French Ivory Coast. It is probable that
the Liberian chimpanzee may offer one or more distinct varieties;
there is an interesting local development of the Diana monkey,
sometimes called the bay-thighed monkey (<i>Cercopithecus diana
ignita</i>) on account of its brilliant orange-red thighs. One or more
species of bats are peculiar to the country&mdash;<i>Vespertilio stampflii</i>,
and perhaps <i>Roussettus büttikoferi</i>; two species of shrew (<i>Crocidura</i>),
one dormouse (<i>Graphiurus nagtglasii</i>); the pygmy hippopotamus
(<i>H. liberiensis</i>)&mdash;differing from the common hippopotamus by its
much smaller size and by the reduction of the incisor teeth to a
single pair in either jaw, or occasionally to the odd number of three;
and two remarkable <i>Cephalophus</i> antelopes peculiar to this region
so far as is known&mdash;these are the white-shouldered duiker, <i>Cephalophus
jentinki</i>, and the zebra antelope, <i>C. doriae</i>, a creature the size
of a small goat, of a bright bay brown, with broad black zebra-like
stripes. Amongst other interesting mammals are four species of the
long-haired <i>Colobus</i> monkeys (black, black and white, greenish-grey
and reddish-brown); the Potto lemur, fruit bats of large size
with monstrous heads (<i>Hypsignathus monstrosus</i>); the brush-tailed
African porcupine; several very brightly coloured squirrels;
the scaly-tailed flying <i>Anomalurus</i>; the common porcupine; the
leopard, serval, golden cat (<i>Felis celidogaster</i>) in two varieties, the
copper-coloured and the grey, possibly the same animal at different
ages; the striped and spotted hyenas (beyond the forest region);
two large otters; the tree hyrax, elephant and manati; the red
bush pig (<i>Potamochoerus porcus</i>); the West African chevrotain
(<i>Dorcatherium</i>); the Senegalese buffalo; Bongo antelope (<i>Boocercus</i>);
large yellow-backed duiker (<i>Cephalophus sylvicultrix</i>), black duiker,
West African hartebeest (beyond the forest), pygmy antelope
(<i>Neotragus</i>); and three species of <i>Manis</i> or pangolin (<i>M. gigantea</i>,
<i>M. longicaudata</i> and <i>M. tricuspis</i>).</p>

<p>The birds of Liberia are not quite so peculiar as the mammals.
There is the interesting white-necked guineafowl, <i>Agelastes</i> (which is
found on the Gold Coast and elsewhere west of the lower Niger);
there is one peculiar species of eagle owl (<i>Bubo lettii</i>) and a very
handsome sparrow-hawk (<i>Accipiter büttikoferi</i>); a few sun-birds,
warblers and shrikes are peculiar to the region. The other birds
are mainly those of Senegambia and of the West African forest region
generally. A common and handsome bird is the blue plantain-eater
(<i>Corythaeola</i>). The fishing vulture (<i>Gypohierax</i>) is found in all the
coast districts, but true vultures are almost entirely absent except
from the north, where the small brown <i>Percnopterus</i> makes its
appearance. A flamingo (<i>Phoeniconaias</i>) visits Fisherman Lake,
and there are a good many species of herons. Cuckoos are abundant,
some of them of lovely plumage, also rollers, kingfishers and horn-bills.
The last family is well represented, especially by the three
forest forms&mdash;the elate hornbill and black hornbill (<i>Ceratogymna</i>),
and the long-tailed, white-crested hornbill (<i>Ortholophus leucolophus</i>).
There is one trogon&mdash;green and crimson, a brightly coloured ground
thrush (<i>Pitta</i>), numerous woodpeckers and barbets; glossy starlings,
the black and white African crow and a great variety of brilliantly
coloured weaver birds, waxbills, shrikes and sun-birds.</p>

<p>As regards reptiles, there are at least seven poisonous snakes&mdash;two
cobras, two puff-adders and three vipers. The brilliantly coloured
red and blue lizard (<i>Agama colonorum</i>) is found in the coast region
of eastern Liberia. There are three species of crocodile, at least two
chameleons (probably more when the forest is further explored), the
large West African python (<i>P. sebae</i>) and a rare Boine snake (Calabaria).
On the sea coast there is the leathery turtle (<i>Dermochelis</i>)
and also the green turtle (<i>Chelone</i>). In the rivers and swamps there
are soft-shelled turtle (<i>Trionyx</i> and <i>Sternothaerus</i>). The land tortoises
chiefly belong to the genus <i>Cynyxis</i>. The fresh-water fish
seem in their affinities to be nearly allied to those of the Niger and
the Nile. There is a species of <i>Polypterus</i>, and it is probable that the
<i>Protopterus</i> or lung fish is also found there, though its existence has
not as yet been established by a specimen. As regards invertebrates,
very few species or genera are peculiar to Liberia so far as is yet
known, though there are probably one or two butterflies of local
range. The gigantic scorpions (<i>Pandinus imperator</i>)&mdash;more than 6 in.
long&mdash;are a common feature in the forest. One noteworthy feature
in Liberia, however, is the relative absence of mosquitoes, and the
white ants and some other insect pests are not so troublesome here
as in other parts of West Africa. The absence or extreme paucity of
mosquitoes no doubt accounts for the infrequency of malarial fever
in the interior.</p>

<p><i>Flora.</i>&mdash;Nowhere, perhaps, does the flora of West Africa attain a
more wonderful development than in the republic of Liberia and in
the adjoining regions of Sierra Leone and the Ivory Coast. This is
partly due to the equatorial position and the heavy rainfall. The
region of dense forest, however, does not cover the whole of Liberia;
the Makona river and the northern tributaries of the Lofa and St
Paul&rsquo;s flow through a mountainous country covered with grass and
thinly scattered trees, while the ravines and watercourses are still
richly forested. A good deal of this absence of forest is directly due
to the action of man. Year by year the influence of the Mahommedan
tribes on the north leads to the cutting down of the forest, the extension
of both planting and pasture and the introduction of cattle
and even horses. In the regions bordering the coast also a good
deal of the forest has disappeared, its place being taken (where the
land is not actually cultivated) by very dense scrub. The most
striking trees in the forest region are, in the basin of the Cavalla,
the giant <i>Funtumia elastica</i>, which grows to an altitude of 200 ft.;
various kinds of <i>Parinarium</i>, <i>Oldfieldia</i> and <i>Khaya</i>; the bombax
or cotton tree, giant dracaenas, many kinds of fig; <i>Borassus</i> palms,
oil palms, the climbing <i>Calamus</i> palms, and on the coast the coconut.
The most important palm of the country perhaps is the
<i>Raphia vinifera</i>, which produces the piassava fibre of commerce.
There are about twenty-two different trees, shrubs and vines producing
rubber of more or less good quality. These belong chiefly
to the Apocynaceous order. In this order is the genus <i>Strophanthus</i>,
which is represented in Liberia by several species, amongst others
<i>S. gratus</i>. This <i>Strophanthus</i> is not remarkable for its rubber&mdash;which
is mere bird lime&mdash;but for the powerful poison of its seeds,
often used for poisoning arrows, but of late much in use as a drug
for treating diseases of the heart. Coffee of several species is indigenous
and grows wild. The best known is the celebrated <i>Coffea
liberica</i>. The kola tree is also indigenous. Large edible nuts are
derived from <i>Coula edulis</i> of the order Olacineae. The country is
exceedingly rich in Aroids, many of which are epiphytic, festooning
the trunks of tall trees with a magnificent drapery of abundant
foliage. A genus much represented is <i>Culcasia</i>, and swampy localities
are thickly set with the giant <i>Cyrtosperma</i> arum, with flower spathes
that are blotched with deep purple. Ground orchids and tree orchids
are well represented; <i>Polystachya liberica</i>, an epiphytic orchid
with sprays of exquisite small flowers of purple and gold, might well
be introduced into horticulture for its beauty. The same might be
said of the magnificent <i>Lissochilus roseus</i>, a terrestrial orchid, growing
to 7 ft. in height, with rose-coloured flowers nearly 1 in. long; there
are other orchids of fantastic design in their green and white flowers,
some of which have spurs (nectaries) nearly 7 in. long.</p>

<p>Many trees offer magnificent displays of flowers at certain seasons
of the year; perhaps the loveliest effect is derived from the bushes
and trailing creepers of the <i>Combretum</i> genus, which, during the
&ldquo;winter&rdquo; months from December to March, cover the scrub and the
forest with mantles of rose colour. <i>Smaethmannia</i> trees are thickly
set at this season with large blossoms of waxen white. Very beautiful
also are the red velvet or white velvet sepals of the <i>Mussaenda</i>
genus. Bamboos of the genus <i>Oxytenanthera</i> are indigenous. Tree
ferns are found on the mountains above 4000 ft. The bracken grows
in low sandy tracts near the coast. The country in general is a fern
paradise, and the iridescent creeping <i>Selaginella</i> (akin to <i>Lycopodium</i>)
festoons the undergrowth by the wayside. The cultivated trees and
plants of importance are, besides rubber, the manioc or cassada,
the orange tree, lime, cacao, coffee, pineapple (which now runs wild
over the whole of Liberia), sour sop, ginger, papaw, alligator apple,
avocado pear, okro, cotton (<i>Gossypium peruvianum</i>&mdash;the kidney
cotton), indigo, sweet potato, capsicum (chillie), bread-fruit, arrowroot
(<i>Maranta</i>), banana, yam, &ldquo;coco&rdquo;-yam (<i>Colocasia antiquorum</i>,
var. <i>esculenta</i>), maize, sorghum, sugar cane, rice and eleusine (<i>Eleusine</i>),
besides gourds, pumpkins, cabbages and onions.</p>

<p><i>Minerals.</i>&mdash;The hinterland of Liberia has been but slightly explored
for mineral wealth. In a general way it is supposed that the
lands lying between the lower St Paul&rsquo;s river and the Sierra Leone
frontier are not much mineralized, except that in the vicinity of
river mouths there are indications of bitumen. The sand of nearly
all the rivers contains a varying proportion of gold. Garnets and
mica are everywhere found. There have been repeated stories of
diamonds obtained from the Finley Mountains (which are volcanic)
in the central province, but all specimens sent home, except one,
have hitherto proved to be quartz crystals. There are indications
of sapphires and other forms of corundum. Corundum indeed is
abundantly met with in the eastern half of Liberia. The sand of the
rivers contains monazite. Graphite has been discovered in the P&#333;
Hills. Lead has been reported from the Nidi or Niete Mountains.
Gold is present in some abundance in the river sand of central
Liberia, and native reports speak of the far interior as being rich
in gold. Iron&mdash;haematite&mdash;is present almost everywhere. There
are other indications of bitumen, besides those mentioned, in the
coast region of eastern Liberia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page541" id="page541"></a>541</span></p>

<p><i>History and Population.</i>&mdash;Tradition asserts that the Liberian
coast was first visited by Europeans when it was reached by the
Dieppois merchant-adventurers in the 14th century. The
French in the 17th century claimed that but for the loss of the
archives of Dieppe they would be able to prove that vessels from
this Norman port had established settlements at Grand Basa,
Cape Mount, and other points on the coast of Liberia. No proof
has yet been forthcoming, however, that the Portuguese were
not the first white men to reach this coast. The first Portuguese
pioneer was Pedro de Sintra, who discovered and noted in 1461
the remarkable promontory of Cape Mount, Cape Mesurado
(where the capital, Monrovia, is now situated) and the mouth of
the Junk river. In 1462 de Sintra returned with another
Portuguese captain, Sueiro da Costa, and penetrated as far as
Cape Palmas and the Cavalla river. Subsequently the Portuguese
mapped the whole coast of Liberia, and nearly all the
prominent features&mdash;capes, rivers, islets&mdash;off that coast still
bear Portuguese names. From the 16th century onwards,
English, Dutch, German, French and other European traders
contested the commerce of this coast with the Portuguese, and
finally drove them away. In the 18th century France once or
twice thought of establishing colonies here. At the end of the
18th century, when the tide was rising in favour of the abolition
of slavery and the repatriation of slaves, the Grain Coast [so
called from the old trade in the &ldquo;Grains of Paradise&rdquo; or <i>Amomum</i>
pepper] was suggested once or twice as a suitable home for
repatriated negroes. Sierra Leone, however, was chosen first
on account of its possessing an admirable harbour. But in 1821
Cape Mesurado was selected by the American Colonization
Society as an appropriate site for the first detachment of
American freed negroes, whom difficulties in regard to extending
the suffrage in the United States were driving away from a still
slave-holding America. From that date, 1821, onwards to the
present day, negroes and mulattos&mdash;freed slaves or the descendants
of such&mdash;have been crossing the Atlantic in small numbers
to settle on the Liberian coast. The great migrations took place
during the first half of the 19th century. Only two or three
thousand American emigrants&mdash;at most&mdash;have come to Liberia
since 1860.</p>

<p>The colony was really founded by Jehudi Ashmun, a white
American, between 1822 and 1828. The name &ldquo;Liberia&rdquo; was
invented by the Rev. R. R. Gurley in 1824. In 1847 the American
colonists declared their country to be an independent republic,
and its status in this capacity was recognized in 1848-1849 by
most of the great powers with the exception of the United States.
Until 1857 Liberia consisted of two republics&mdash;Liberia and
Maryland. These American settlements were dotted at intervals
along the coast from the mouth of the Sewa river on the west to
the San Pedro river on the east (some 60 m. beyond Cape Palmas).
Some tracts of territory, such as the greater part of the Kru
coast, still, however, remain without foreign&mdash;American&mdash;settlers,
and in a state of quasi-independence. The uncertainty
of Liberian occupation led to frontier troubles with Great
Britain and disputes with France. Finally, by the English and
French treaties of 1885 and 1892 Liberian territory on the coast
was made continuous, but was limited to the strip of about
300 m. between the Mano river on the west and the Cavalla river
on the east. The Sierra Leone-Liberia frontier was demarcated
in 1903; then followed the negotiations with France for the
exact delimitation of the Ivory Coast-Liberia frontier, with the
result that Liberia lost part of the hinterland she had claimed.
Reports of territorial encroachments aroused much sympathy
with Liberia in America and led in February 1909 to the appointment
by President Roosevelt of a commission which visited
Liberia in the summer of that year to investigate the condition
of the country. As a result of the commissioners&rsquo; report negotiations
were set on foot for the adjustment of the Liberian debt
and the placing of United States officials in charge of the Liberian
customs. In July 1910 it was announced that the American
government, acting in general agreement with Great Britain,
France and Germany, would take charge of the finances, military
organization, agriculture and boundary questions of the republic.
A loan for £400,000 was also arranged. Meantime
the attempts of the Liberian government to control the Kru
coast led to various troubles, such as the fining or firing upon
foreign steamships for alleged contraventions of regulations.
During 1910 the natives in the Cape Palmas district were at
open warfare with the Liberian authorities.</p>

<p>One of the most notable of the Liberian presidents was J. J.
Roberts, who was nearly white, with only a small proportion of
negro blood in his veins. But perhaps the ablest statesman that
this American-Negro republic has as yet produced is a pure-blooded
negro&mdash;President Arthur Barclay, a native of Barbados
in the West Indies, who came to Liberia with his parents in the
middle of the 19th century, and received all his education there.
President Barclay was of unmixed negro descent, but came of a
Dahomey stock of superior type.<a name="fa1g" id="fa1g" href="#ft1g"><span class="sp">1</span></a> Until the accession to power of
President Barclay in 1904 (he was re-elected in 1907), the Americo-Liberian
government on the coast had very uncertain relations
with the indigenous population, which is well armed and tenacious
of local independence. But of late Liberian influence has been
extending, more especially in the counties of Maryland and
Montserrado.</p>

<p>The president is now elected for a term of four years. There
is a legislature of eight senators and thirteen representatives.
The type of the constitution is very like that of the United
States. Increasing attention is being given to education, to
deal with which there are several colleges and a number of
schools. The judicial functions are discharged by four grades of
officials&mdash;the local magistrates, the courts of common pleas,
the quarterly courts (five in number) and the supreme court.</p>

<p>The customs service includes British customs officers lent to
the Liberian service. A gunboat for preventive service purchased
from the British government and commanded by an Englishman,
with native petty officers and crew, is employed by the Liberian
government. The language of government and trade is English,
which is understood far and wide throughout Liberia. As the
origin of the Sierra Leonis and the Americo-Liberian settlers
was very much the same, an increasing intimacy is growing up
between the English-speaking populations of these adjoining
countries. Order is maintained in Liberia to some extent by a
militia.</p>

<p>The population of Americo-Liberian origin in the coast regions
is estimated at from 12,000 to 15,000. To these must be added
about 40,000 civilized and Christianized negroes who make
common cause with the Liberians in most matters, and have
gradually been filling the position of Liberian citizens.</p>

<p>For administrative purposes the country is divided into four
counties, Montserrado, Basa, Sino and Maryland, but Cape
Mount in the far west and the district round it has almost the
status of a fifth county. The approximate revenue for 1906
was £65,000, and the expenditure about £60,000, but some of
the revenue was still collected in paper of uncertain value. There
are three custom-houses, or ports of entry on the Sierra Leone
land frontier between the Moa river on the north and the Mano
on the south, and nine ports of entry along the coast. At all
of these Europeans are allowed to settle and trade, and with
very slight restrictions they may now trade almost anywhere in
Liberia. The rubber trade is controlled by the Liberian Rubber
Corporation, which holds a special concession from the Liberian
government for a number of years, and is charged with the preservation
of the forests. Another English company has constructed
motor roads in the Liberian hinterland to connect
centres of trade with the St Paul&rsquo;s river. The trade is done
almost entirely with Great Britain, Germany and Holland, but
friendly relations are maintained with Spain, as the Spanish
plantations in Fernando P&#333; are to a great extent worked by
Liberian labour.</p>

<p>The indigenous population must be considered one of the
assets of Liberia. The native population&mdash;apart from the
American element&mdash;is estimated at as much as 2,000,000; for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page542" id="page542"></a>542</span>
although large areas appear to be uninhabited forest, other
parts are most densely populated, owing to the wonderful
fertility of the soil. The native tribes belong more or less to
the following divisions, commencing on the west, and proceeding
eastwards: (1) Vai, Gbandi, Kpwesi, Mende, Buzi and Mandingo
(the Vai, Mende and Mandingo are Mahommedans); all these
tribes speak languages derived from a common stock. (2) In
the densest forest region between the Mano and the St Paul&rsquo;s
river is the powerful Gora tribe of unknown linguistic affinities.
(3) In the coast region between the St Paul&rsquo;s river and the
Cavalla (and beyond) are the different tribes of Kru stock and
language family&mdash;D&#275;, Bas&#257;, Gibi, Kru, Grebo, Putu, Sikoñ, &amp;c.
&amp;c. The actual Kru tribe inhabits the coast between the river
Cestos on the west and Grand Sesters on the east. It is known
all over the Atlantic coasts of Africa, as it furnishes such a large
proportion of the seamen employed on men-of-war and merchant
ships in these tropical waters. Many of the indigenous races
of Liberia in the forest belt beyond 40 m. from the coast still
practise cannibalism. In some of these forest tribes the women
still go quite naked, but clothes of a Mahommedan type are fast
spreading over the whole country. Some of the indigenous
races are of very fine physique. In the Nidi country the women
are generally taller than the men. No traces of a Pygmy race
have as yet been discovered, nor any negroes of low physiognomy.
Some of the Krumen are coarse and ugly, and this is the case
with the Mende people; but as a rule the indigenes of Liberia
are handsome, well-proportioned negroes, and some of the
Mandingos have an almost European cast of feature.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIBERIUS,<a name="ar77" id="ar77"></a></span> pope from 352 to 366, the successor of Julius I.,
was consecrated according to the <i>Catalogus Liberianus</i> on the
22nd of May. His first recorded act was, after a synod had
been held at Rome, to write to Constantius, then in quarters at
Arles (353-354), asking that a council might be called at Aquileia
with reference to the affairs of Athanasius; but his messenger
Vincentius of Capua was compelled by the emperor at a conciliabulum
held in Arles to subscribe against his will a condemnation
of the orthodox patriarch of Alexandria. In 355
Liberius was one of the few who, along with Eusebius of Vercelli,
Dionysius of Milan and Lucifer of Cagliari, refused to sign the
condemnation of Athanasius, which had anew been imposed at
Milan by imperial command upon all the Western bishops; the
consequence was his relegation to Beroea in Thrace, Felix II.
(antipope) being consecrated his successor by three &ldquo;catascopi
haud episcopi,&rdquo; as Athanasius called them. At the end of an
exile of more than two years he yielded so far as to subscribe a
formula giving up the &ldquo;homoousios,&rdquo; to abandon Athanasius,
and to accept the communion of his adversaries&mdash;a serious
mistake, with which he has justly been reproached. This submission
led the emperor to recall him from exile; but, as the
Roman see was officially occupied by Felix, a year passed before
Liberius was sent to Rome. It was the emperor&rsquo;s intention that
Liberius should govern the Church jointly with Felix, but on
the arrival of Liberius, Felix was expelled by the Roman people.
Neither Liberius nor Felix took part in the council of Rimini
(359). After the death of the emperor Constantius in 361,
Liberius annulled the decrees of that assembly, but, with the
concurrence of SS. Athanasius and Hilarius, retained the bishops
who had signed and then withdrawn their adherence. In 366
Liberius gave a favourable reception to a deputation of the
Eastern episcopate, and admitted into his communion the more
moderate of the old Arian party. He died on the 24th of
September 366.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>His biographers used to be perplexed by a letter purporting to be
from Liberius, in the works of Hilary, in which he seems to write,
in 352, that he had excommunicated Athanasius at the instance of
the Oriental bishops; but the document is now held to be spurious.
See Hefele, <i>Conciliengesch</i>. i. 648 seq. Three other letters, though
contested by Hefele, seem to have been written by Liberius at the
time of his submission to the emperor.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIBER PONTIFICALIS,<a name="ar78" id="ar78"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Gesta Pontificum Romanorum</span>
(<i>i.e.</i> book of the popes), consists of the lives of the bishops of
Rome from the time of St Peter to the death of Nicholas I. in
867. A supplement continues the series of lives almost to the
close of the 9th century, and several other continuations were
written later. During the 16th century there was some discussion
about the authorship of the <i>Liber</i>, and for some time it
was thought to be the work of an Italian monk, Anastasius
Bibliothecarius (d. 886). It is now, however, practically certain
that it was of composite authorship and that the earlier part of
it was compiled about 530, three centuries before the time of
Anastasius. This is the view taken by Louis Duchesne and
substantially by G. Waitz and T. Mommsen, although these
scholars think that it was written about a century later. The
<i>Liber</i> contains much information about papal affairs in general,
and about endowments, martyrdoms and the like, but a considerable
part of it is obviously legendary. It assumes that the
bishops of Rome exercised authority over the Christian Church
from its earliest days.</p>

of a narrow, arid, sandy coast zone and the western slopes
of the Cordillera broken into valleys by short mountain spurs,
and the eastern a high inter-Andine valley lying between
the Western and Central Cordilleras and traversed by the upper
Marañon or Amazon, which at one point is less than 90 m. in
a straight line from the Pacific coast. The coast region is
traversed by several short streams, which are fed by the melting
snows of the Cordillera and are extensively used for irrigation.
These are (the names also applying to their valleys) the Jequetepeque
or Pacasmayo, in whose valley rice is an important product,
the Chicama, in whose valley the sugar plantations are among
the largest and best in Peru, the Moche, Viru, Chao and Santa;
the last, with its northern tributary, the Tablachaca, forming the
southern boundary line of the department. The Santa Valley
is also noted for its sugar plantations. Cotton is produced in
several of these valleys, coffee in the Pacasmayo district, and
coca on the mountain slopes about Huamachuco and Otuzco,
at elevations of 3000 to 6000 ft. above sea-level. The upland
regions, which have a moderate rainfall and a cool, healthy
climate, are partly devoted to agriculture on a small scale
(producing wheat, Indian corn, barley, potatoes, quinua, alfalfa,
fruit and vegetables), partly to grazing and partly to mining.
Cattle and sheep have been raised on the upland pastures of
Libertad and Ancachs since early colonial times, and the llama
and alpaca were reared throughout this &ldquo;sierra&rdquo; country long
before the Spanish conquest. Gold and silver mines are worked
in the districts of Huamachuco, Otuzco and Pataz, and coal has
been found in the first two. The department had 169 m. of railway
in 1906, viz.: from Pacasmayo to Yonán (in Cajamarca)
with a branch to Guadalupe, 60 m.; from Salaverry to Trujillo
with its extension to Ascope, 47 m.; from Trujillo to Laredo,
Galindo and Menocucho, 18½ m.; from Huanchaco to Roma,
25 m.; and from Chicama to Pampas, 18½ m. The principal
ports are Pacasmayo and Salaverry, which have long iron piers
built by the national government; Malabrigo, Huanchuco,
Guañape and Chao are open roadsteads. The capital of the
department is Trujillo. The other principal towns are San
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page543" id="page543"></a>543</span>
Pedro, Otuzco, Huamachuco, Santiago de Chuco and Tuyabamba&mdash;all provincial capitals and important only through their
mining interests, except San Pedro, which stands in the fertile
district of the Jequetepeque. The population of Otuzco (35 m.
N.E. of Trujillo) was estimated to be about 4000 in 1896, that
of Huamachuco (65 m. N.E. of Trujillo) being perhaps slightly
less.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIBERTARIANISM<a name="ar80" id="ar80"></a></span> (from Lat. <i>libertas</i>, freedom), in ethics,
the doctrine which maintains the freedom of the will, as opposed
to necessitarianism or determinism. It has been held in various
forms. In its extreme form it maintains that the individual
is absolutely free to chose this or that action indifferently (the
<i>liberum arbitrium indifferentiae</i>), but most libertarians admit
that acquired tendencies, environment and the like, exercise
control in a greater or less degree.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIBERTINES,<a name="ar81" id="ar81"></a></span> the nickname, rather than the name, given to
various political and social parties. It is futile to deduce the
name from the Libertines of Acts vi. 9; these were &ldquo;sons of
freedmen,&rdquo; for it is vain to make them citizens of an imaginary
Libertum, or to substitute (with Beza) Libustines, in the sense
of inhabitants of Libya. In a sense akin to the modern use
of the term &ldquo;libertine,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> a person who sets the rules of
morality, &amp;c., at defiance, the word seems first to have been
applied, as a stigma, to Anabaptists in the Low Countries (Mark
Pattison, <i>Essays</i>, ii. 38). It has become especially attached
to the liberal party in Geneva, opposed to Calvin and carrying on
the tradition of the Liberators in that city; but the term was
never applied to them till after Calvin&rsquo;s death (F. W. Kampschulte,
<i>Johann Calvin</i>). Calvin, who wrote against the
&ldquo;Libertins qui se nomment Spirituelz&rdquo; (1545), never confused
them with his political antagonists in Geneva, called Perrinistes
from their leader Amadeo Perrin. The objects of Calvin&rsquo;s
polemic were the Anabaptists above mentioned, whose first
obscure leader was Coppin of Lisle, followed by Quintin of
Hennegau, by whom and his disciples, Bertram des Moulins
and Claude Perseval, the principles of the sect were disseminated
in France. Quintin was put to death as a heretic at Tournai
in 1546. His most notable follower was Antoine Pocquet, a
native of Enghien, Belgium, priest and almoner (1540-1549),
afterwards pensioner of the queen of Navarre, who was a guest
of Bucer at Strassburg (1543-1544) and died some time after 1560.
Calvin (who had met Quintin in Paris) describes the doctrines
he impugns as pantheistic and antinomian.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIBERTY<a name="ar83" id="ar83"></a></span> (Lat. <i>libertas</i>, from <i>liber</i>, free), generally the state
of freedom, especially opposed to subjection, imprisonment
or slavery, or with such restricted or figurative meaning as the
circumstances imply. The history of political liberty is in
modern days identified practically with the progress of civilization.
In a more particular sense, &ldquo;a liberty&rdquo; is the term for
a franchise, a privilege or branch of the crown&rsquo;s prerogative
granted to a subject, as, for example, that of executing legal
process; hence the district over which the privilege extends.
Such liberties are exempt from the jurisdiction of the sheriff
and have separate commissions of the peace, but for purposes of
local government form part of the county in which they are
situated. The exemption from the jurisdiction of the sheriff
was recognized in England by the Sheriffs Act 1887, which
provides that the sheriff of a county shall appoint a deputy at the
expense of the lord of the liberty, such deputy to reside in or
near the liberty. The deputy receives and opens in the sheriff&rsquo;s
name all writs, the return or execution of which belongs to the
bailiff of the liberty, and issues to the bailiff the warrant required
for the due execution of such writs. The bailiff then
becomes liable for non-execution, mis-execution or insufficient
return of any writs, and in the case of non-return of any writ,
if the sheriff returns that he has delivered the writ to a bailiff
of a liberty, the sheriff will be ordered to execute the writ notwithstanding
the liberty, and must cause the bailiff to attend
before the high court of justice and answer why he did not
execute the writ.</p>

<p>In nautical phraseology various usages of the term are derived
from its association with a sailor&rsquo;s leave on shore, <i>e.g.</i> liberty-man,
liberty-day, liberty-ticket.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIBERTY PARTY,<a name="ar84" id="ar84"></a></span> the first political party organized in the
United States to oppose the spread and restrict the political power
of slavery, and the lineal precursor of the Free Soil and Republican
parties. It originated in the Old North-west. Its organization
was preceded there by a long anti-slavery religious movement.
James G. Birney (<i>q.v.</i>), to whom more than to any other man
belongs the honour of founding and leading the party, began to
define the political duties of so-called &ldquo;abolitionists&rdquo; about
1836; but for several years thereafter he, in common with other
leaders, continued to disclaim all idea of forming a political
party. In state and local campaigns, however, non-partisan
political action was attempted through the questioning of Whig
and Democratic candidates. The utter futility of seeking to
obtain in this way any satisfactory concessions to anti-slavery
sentiment was speedily and abundantly proved. There arose,
consequently, a division in the American Anti-slavery Society
between those who were led by W. L. Garrison (<i>q.v.</i>), and advocated
political non-resistance&mdash;and, besides, had loaded down
their anti-slavery views with a variety of religious and social
vagaries, unpalatable to all but a small number&mdash;and those who
were led by Birney, and advocated independent political action.
The sentiment of the great majority of &ldquo;abolitionists&rdquo; was,
by 1838, strongly for such action; and it was clearly sanctioned
and implied in the constitution and declared principles of the
Anti-slavery Society; but the capture of that organization by
the Garrisonians, in a &ldquo;packed&rdquo; convention in 1830, made it
unavailable as a party nucleus&mdash;even if it had not been already
outgrown&mdash;and hastened a separate party organization. A
convention of abolitionists at Warsaw, New York, in November
1839 had resolved that abolitionists were bound by every
consideration of duty and expediency to organize an independent
political party. Accordingly, the political abolitionists, in
another convention at Albany, in April 1840, containing delegates
from six states but not one from the North-west, launched the
&ldquo;Liberty Party,&rdquo; and nominated Birney for the presidency.
In the November election he received 7069 votes.<a name="fa1h" id="fa1h" href="#ft1h"><span class="sp">1</span></a></p>

<p>The political &ldquo;abolitionists&rdquo; were abolitionists only as they
were restrictionists: they wished to use the federal government
to exclude (or abolish) slavery from the federal Territories and
the District of Columbia, but they saw no opportunity to attack
slavery in the states&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> to attack the institution <i>per se</i>; also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page544" id="page544"></a>544</span>
they declared there should be &ldquo;absolute and unqualified division
of the General Government from slavery&rdquo;&mdash;which implied an
amendment of the constitution. They proposed to use ordinary
moral and political means to attain their ends&mdash;not, like the
Garrisonians, to abstain from voting, or favour the dissolution of
the Union.</p>

<p>After 1840 the attempt began in earnest to organize the
Liberty Party thoroughly, and unite all anti-slavery men.
The North-west, where &ldquo;there was, after 1840, very little known
of Garrison and his methods&rdquo; (T. C. Smith), was the most promising
field, but though the contest of state and local campaigns
gave morale to the party, it made scant political gains (in 1843
it cast hardly 10% of the total vote); it could not convince the
people that slavery should be made the paramount question in
politics. In 1844, however, the Texas question gave slavery
precisely this pre-eminence in the presidential campaign. Until
then, neither Whigs nor Democrats had regarded the Liberty
Party seriously; now, however, each party charged that the
Liberty movement was corruptly auxiliary to the other. As the
campaign progressed, the Whigs alternately abused the Liberty
men and made frantic appeals for their support. But the
Liberty men were strongly opposed to Clay personally; and
even if his equivocal campaign letters (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Clay, Henry</a></span>) had
not left exceedingly small ground for belief that he would resist
the annexation of Texas, still the Liberty men were not such as
to admit that an end justifies the means; therefore they again
nominated Birney. He received 62,263 votes<a name="fa2h" id="fa2h" href="#ft2h"><span class="sp">2</span></a>&mdash;many more
than enough in New York to have carried that state and the
presidency for Clay, had they been thrown to his support. The
Whigs, therefore, blamed the Liberty Party for Democratic
success and the annexation of Texas; but&mdash;quite apart from
the issue of political ethics&mdash;it is almost certain that though
Clay&rsquo;s chances were injured by the Liberty ticket, they were
injured much more outside the Liberty ranks, by his own
quibbles.<a name="fa3h" id="fa3h" href="#ft3h"><span class="sp">3</span></a> After 1844 the Liberty Party made little progress.
Its leaders were never very strong as politicians, and its ablest
organizer, Birney, was about this time compelled by an accident
to abandon public life. Moreover, the election of 1844 was in a
way fatal to the party; for it seemed to prove that though
&ldquo;abolition&rdquo; was not the party programme, still its antecedents
and personnel were too radical to unite the North; and above
all it could not, after 1844, draw the disaffected Whigs, for
though their party was steadily moving toward anti-slavery
their dislike of the Liberty Party effectually prevented union.
Indeed, no party of one idea could hope to satisfy men who had
been Whigs or Democrats. At the same time, anti-slavery Whigs
and Democrats were segregating in state politics, and the issue
of excluding slavery from the new territory acquired from Mexico
afforded a golden opportunity to unite all anti-slavery men on
the principle of the Wilmot Proviso (1846). The Liberty Party
reached its greatest strength (casting 74,017 votes) in the state
elections of 1846. Thereafter, though growing somewhat in
New England, it rapidly became ineffective in the rest of the
North. Many, including Birney, thought it should cease to be
an isolated party of one idea&mdash;striving for mere balance of
power between Whigs and Democrats, welcoming small concessions
from them, almost dependent upon them. Some wished
to revivify it by making it a party of general reform. One result
was the secession and formation of the Liberty League, which in
1847 nominated Gerrit Smith for the presidency. No adequate
effort was made to take advantage of the disintegration of other
parties. In October 1847, at Buffalo, was held the third and last
national convention. John P. Hale&mdash;whose election to the
United States Senate had justified the first successful union of
Liberty men with other anti-slavery men in state politics&mdash;was
nominated for the presidency. But the nomination by the
Democrats of Lewis Cass shattered the Democratic organization
in New York and the North-west; and when the Whigs nominated
General Taylor, adopted a non-committal platform, and showed
hostility to the Wilmot Proviso, the way was cleared for a union
of all anti-slavery men. The Liberty Party, abandoning therefore
its independent nominations, joined in the first convention
and nominations of the Free Soil Party (<i>q.v.</i>), thereby practically
losing its identity, although it continued until after the organization
of the Republican Party to maintain something of a semi-independent
organization. The Liberty Party has the unique
honour among third-parties in the United States of seeing its
principles rapidly adopted and realized.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIBITINA,<a name="ar85" id="ar85"></a></span> an old Roman goddess of funerals. She had a
sanctuary in a sacred grove (perhaps on the Esquiline), where,
by an ordinance of Servius Tullius, a piece of money (<i>lucar
Libitinae</i>) was deposited whenever a death took place. Here
the undertakers (<i>libitinarii</i>), who carried out all funeral arrangements
by contract, had their offices, and everything necessary
was kept for sale or hire; here all deaths were registered for
statistical purposes. The word <i>Libitina</i> then came to be used
for the business of an undertaker, funeral requisites, and (in the
poets) for death itself. By later antiquarians Libitina was
sometimes identified with Persephone, but more commonly
(partly or completely) with Venus Lubentia or Lubentina, an
Italian goddess of gardens. The similarity of name and the fact
that Venus Lubentia had a sanctuary in the grove of Libitina
favoured this idea. Further, Plutarch (<i>Quaest. Rom.</i> 23)
mentions a small statue at Delphi of Aphrodite Epitymbia
(A. of tombs = Venus Libitina), to which the spirits of the dead
were summoned. The inconsistency of selling funeral requisites
in the temple of Libitina, seeing that she is identified with Venus,
is explained by him as indicating that one and the same goddess
presides over birth and death; or the association of such things
with the goddess of love and pleasure is intended to show that
death is not a calamity, but rather a consummation to be desired.
Libitina may, however, have been originally an earth goddess,
connected with luxuriant nature and the enjoyments of life
(cf. <i>lub-et</i>, <i>lib-ido</i>); then, all such deities being connected with the
underworld, she also became the goddess of death, and that side
of her character predominated in the later conceptions.</p>

arrondissement of the department of Gironde, situated at the
confluence of the Isle with the Dordogne, 22 m. E.N.E. of Bordeaux
on the railway to Angoulême. Pop. (1906) town, 15,280;
commune, 19,323. The sea is 56 m. distant, but the tide affects
the river so as to admit of vessels drawing 14 ft. reaching the
town at the highest tides. The Dordogne is here crossed by a
stone bridge 492 ft. long, and a suspension bridge across the Isle
connects Libourne with Fronsac, built on a hill on which in
feudal times stood a powerful fortress. Libourne is regularly
built. The Gothic church, restored in the 19th century, has a

clock-tower which is a survival of the ramparts of the 14th

<p><span class="bold">LIBRARIES.<a name="ar91" id="ar91"></a></span> A library (from Lat. <i>liber</i>, book), in the modern
sense, is a collection of printed or written literature. As such, it
implies an advanced and elaborate civilization. If the term be
extended to any considerable collection of written documents,
it must be nearly as old as civilization itself. The earliest
use to which the invention of inscribed or written signs was put
was probably to record important religious and political transactions.
These records would naturally be preserved in sacred
places, and accordingly the earliest libraries of the world were
probably temples, and the earliest librarians priests. And
indeed before the extension of the arts of writing and reading the
priests were the only persons who could perform such work as,
<i>e.g.</i> the compilation of the <i>Annales Maximi</i>, which was the duty
of the pontifices in ancient Rome. The beginnings of literature
proper in the shape of ballads and songs may have continued to
be conveyed orally only from one generation to another, long after
the record of important religious or civil events was regularly
committed to writing. The earliest collections of which we
know anything, therefore, were collections of archives. Of this
character appear to have been such famous collections as that
of the Medians at Ecbatana, the Persians at Susa or the hieroglyphic
archives of Knossos discovered by A. J. Evans (<i>Scripta
Minoa</i>, 1909) of a date synchronizing with the XIIth Egyptian
dynasty. It is not until the development of arts and sciences,
and the growth of a considerable written literature, and even of
a distinct literary class, that we find collections of books which
can be called libraries in our modern sense. It is of libraries
in the modern sense, and not, except incidentally, of archives
that we are to speak.</p>

<p class="pt2 center"><span class="sc">Ancient Libraries</span></p>

<p>The researches which have followed the discoveries of P. E.
Botta and Sir H. Layard have thrown unexpected light
not only upon the history but upon the arts, the
sciences and the literatures of the ancient civilizations
<span class="sidenote">Assyria.</span>
of Babylonia and Assyria. In all these wondrous revelations no
facts are more interesting than those which show the existence
of extensive libraries so many ages ago, and none are more
eloquent of the elaborateness of these forgotten civilizations.
In the course of his excavations at Nineveh in 1850, Layard
came upon some chambers in the south-west palace, the floor of
which, as well as the adjoining rooms, was covered to the depth
of a foot with tablets of clay, covered with cuneiform characters,
in many cases so small as to require a magnifying glass. These
varied in size from 1 to 12 in. square. A great number of them
were broken, as Layard supposed by the falling in of the roof,
but as George Smith thought by having fallen from the upper
storey, upon which he believed the collection to have been placed.
These tablets formed the library of the great monarch Assur-bani-pal&mdash;the
Sardanapalus of the Greeks&mdash;the greatest patron
of literature amongst the Assyrians. It is estimated that this
library consisted of some ten thousand distinct works and documents,
some of the works extending over several tablets. The
tablets appear to have been methodically arranged and catalogued,
and the library seems to have been thrown open for the
general use of the king&rsquo;s subjects.<a name="fa1j" id="fa1j" href="#ft1j"><span class="sp">1</span></a> A great portion of this
library has already been brought to England and deposited in
the British museum, but it is calculated that there still remain
some 20,000 fragments to be gathered up. For further details
as to Assyrian libraries, and the still earlier Babylonian libraries
at Tello, the ancient Lagash, and at Niffer, the ancient Nippur,
from which the Assyrians drew their science and literature, see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Babylonia</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Nippur</a></span>.</p>

<p>Of the libraries of ancient Egypt our knowledge is scattered
and imperfect, but at a time extending to more than 6000 years
ago we find numerous scribes of many classes who recorded
official events in the life of their royal masters
<span class="sidenote">Ancient Egyptian Libraries.</span>
or details of their domestic affairs and business transactions.
Besides this official literature we possess
examples of many commentaries on the sacerdotal books, as well
as historical treatises, works on moral philosophy and proverbial
wisdom, science, collections of medical receipts as well as a great
variety of popular novels and humoristic pieces. At an early
date Heliopolis was a literary centre of great importance with
culture akin to the Babylonian. Attached to every temple
were professional scribes whose function was partly religious
and partly scientific. The sacred books of Thoth constituted as
it were a complete encyclopaedia of religion and science, and on
these books was gradually accumulated an immense mass of
exposition and commentary. We possess a record relating to
&ldquo;the land of the collected works [library] of Khufu,&rdquo; a monarch
of the IVth dynasty, and a similar inscription relating to the
library of Khafra, the builder of the second pyramid. At Edfu
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page546" id="page546"></a>546</span>
the library was a small chamber in the temple, on the wall of
which is a list of books, among them a manual of Egyptian
geography (Brugsch, <i>History of Egypt</i>, 1881, i. 240). The exact
position of Akhenaten&rsquo;s library (or archives) of clay tablets is
known and the name of the room has been read on the books
of which it has been built. A library of charred books has been
found at Mendes (Egypt Expl. Fund, <i>Two Hieroglyphic Papyri</i>),
and we have references to temple libraries in the Silsileh &ldquo;Nile&rdquo;
stelae and perhaps in the great Harris papyri. The most famous
of the Egyptian libraries is that of King Osymandyas, described
by Diodorus Siculus, who relates that it bore an inscription
which he renders by the Greek words <span class="grk" title="PSUCHÊS IATREION">&#936;&#933;&#935;&#919;&#931; &#921;&#913;&#932;&#929;&#917;&#921;&#927;&#925;</span> &ldquo;the
Dispensary of the Soul.&rdquo; Osymandyas has been identified with
the great king Rameses II. (1300-1236 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) and the seat of the
library is supposed to have been the Ramessaeum at Western
Thebes. Amen-em-hant was the name of one of the directors of
the Theban libraries. Papyri from the palace, of a later date,
have been discovered by Professor W. F. Flinders Petrie. At
Thebes the scribes of the &ldquo;Foreign Office&rdquo; are depicted at work
in a room which was perhaps rather an office than a library.
The famous Tel-el-Amarna tablets (1383-1365 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) were stored
in &ldquo;the place of the records of the King.&rdquo; There were record
offices attached to the granary and treasury departments and
we know of a school or college for the reproduction of books,
which were kept in boxes and in jars. According to Eustathius
there was a great collection at Memphis. A heavy blow was
dealt to the old Egyptian literature by the Persian invasion,
and many books were carried away by the conquerors. The
Egyptians were only delivered from the yoke of Persia to succumb
to that of Greece and Rome and henceforward their civilization
was dominated by foreign influences. Of the Greek libraries
under the Ptolemies we shall speak a little further on.</p>

<p>Of the libraries of ancient Greece we have very little knowledge,
and such knowledge as we possess comes to us for the
most part from late compilers. Amongst those who
are known to have collected books are Pisistratus,
<span class="sidenote">Greece.</span>
Polycrates of Samos, Euclid the Athenian, Nicocrates of Cyprus,
Euripides and Aristotle (Athenaeus i. 4). At Cnidus there is
said to have been a special collection of works upon medicine.
Pisistratus is reported to have been the first of the Greeks who
collected books on a large scale. Aulus Gellius, indeed, tells us,
in language perhaps &ldquo;not well suited to the 6th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span>,&rdquo;<a name="fa2j" id="fa2j" href="#ft2j"><span class="sp">2</span></a>
that he was the first to establish a public library. The authority
of Aulus Gellius is hardly sufficient to secure credit for the
story that this library was carried away into Persia by Xerxes
and subsequently restored to the Athenians by Seleucus Nicator.
Plato is known to have been a collector; and Xenophon tells
us of the library of Euthydemus. The library of Aristotle was
bequeathed by him to his disciple Theophrastus, and by Theophrastus
to Neleus, who carried it to Scepsis, where it is said to
have been concealed underground to avoid the literary cupidity
of the kings of Pergamum. Its subsequent fate has given rise
to much controversy, but, according to Strabo (xiii. pp. 608, 609),
it was sold to Apellicon of Teos, who carried it to Athens, where
after Apellicon&rsquo;s death it fell a prey to the conqueror Sulla, and
was transported by him to Rome. The story told by Athenaeus
(i. 4) is that the library of Neleus was purchased by Ptolemy
Philadelphus. The names of a few other libraries in Greece are
barely known to us from inscriptions; of their character and
contents we know nothing. If, indeed, we are to trust Strabo
entirely, we must believe that Aristotle was the first person who
collected a library, and that he communicated the taste for
collecting to the sovereigns of Egypt. It is at all events certain
that the libraries of Alexandria were the most important as they
<span class="sidenote">Alexandria.</span>
were the most celebrated of the ancient world. Under
the enlightened rule of the Ptolemies a society of
scholars and men of science was attracted to their
capital. It seems pretty certain that Ptolemy Soter had already
begun to collect books, but it was in the reign of Ptolemy Philadelphus
that the libraries were properly organized and established
in separate buildings. Ptolemy Philadelphus sent into every
part of Greece and Asia to secure the most valuable works, and
no exertions or expense were spared in enriching the collections.
Ptolemy Euergetes, his successor, is said to have caused all
books brought into Egypt by foreigners to be seized for the
benefit of the library, while the owners had to be content with
receiving copies of them in exchange. Nor did the Alexandrian
scholars exhibit the usual Hellenic exclusiveness, and many of
the treasures of Egyptian and even of Hebrew literature were
by their means translated into Greek. There were two libraries
at Alexandria; the larger, in the Brucheum quarter, was in
connexion with the Museum, a sort of academy, while the smaller
was placed in the Serapeum. The number of volumes in these
libraries was very large, although it is difficult to attain any
certainty as to the real numbers amongst the widely varying
accounts. According to a scholium of Tzetzes, who appears to
draw his information from the authority of Callimachus and
Eratosthenes, who had been librarians at Alexandria, there
were 42,800 vols. or rolls in the Serapeum and 490,000 in the
Brucheum.<a name="fa3j" id="fa3j" href="#ft3j"><span class="sp">3</span></a> This enumeration seems to refer to the librarianship
of Callimachus himself under Ptolemy Euergetes. In any case
the figures agree tolerably well with those given by Aulus Gellius<a name="fa4j" id="fa4j" href="#ft4j"><span class="sp">4</span></a>
(700,000) and Seneca<a name="fa5j" id="fa5j" href="#ft5j"><span class="sp">5</span></a> (400,000). It should be observed that, as
the ancient roll or volume usually contained a much smaller
quantity of matter than a modern book&mdash;so that, <i>e.g.</i> the history
of Herodotus might form nine &ldquo;books&rdquo; or volumes, and the
<i>Iliad</i> of Homer twenty-four&mdash;these numbers must be discounted
for the purposes of comparison with modern collections. The
series of the first five librarians at Alexandria appears to be
pretty well established as follows: Zenodotus, Callimachus,
Eratosthenes, Apollonius and Aristophanes; and their activity
covers a period of about a century. The first experiments in
bibliography appear to have been made in producing catalogues
of the Alexandrian libraries. Amongst other lists, two catalogues
were prepared by order of Ptolemy Philadelphus, one of
the tragedies, the other of the comedies contained in the collections.
The <span class="grk" title="Pinakes">&#928;&#943;&#957;&#945;&#954;&#949;&#962;</span> of Callimachus formed a catalogue of all the
principal books arranged in 120 classes. When Caesar set fire
to the fleet in the harbour of Alexandria, the flames accidentally
extended to the larger library of the Brucheum, and it was
destroyed.<a name="fa6j" id="fa6j" href="#ft6j"><span class="sp">6</span></a> Antony endeavoured to repair the loss by presenting
to Cleopatra the library from Pergamum. This was very probably
placed in the Brucheum, as this continued to be the literary
quarter of Alexandria until the time of Aurelian. Thenceforward
the Serapeum became the principal library. The usual statement
that from the date of the restoration of the Brucheum under
Cleopatra the libraries continued in a flourishing condition until
they were destroyed after the conquest of Alexandria by the
Saracens in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 640 can hardly be supported. It is very possible
that one of the libraries perished when the Brucheum quarter
was destroyed by Aurelian, <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 273. In 389 or 391 an edict of
Theodosius ordered the destruction of the Serapeum, and its
books were pillaged by the Christians. When we take into
account the disordered condition of the times, and the neglect
into which literature and science had fallen, there can be little
difficulty in believing that there were but few books left to be
destroyed by the soldiers of Amru. The familiar anecdote of
the caliph&rsquo;s message to his general rests mainly upon the evidence
of Abulfaraj, so that we may be tempted to agree with Gibbon
that the report of a stranger who wrote at the end of six hundred
years is overbalanced by the silence of earlier and native annalists.
It is, however, so far from easy to settle the question that a
cloud of names could easily be cited upon either side, while some
of the most careful inquirers confess the difficulty of a decision<a name="fa7j" id="fa7j" href="#ft7j"><span class="sp">7</span></a>
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Alexandria</a></span>, III.).</p>

<p>The magnificence and renown of the libraries of the Ptolemies
excited the rivalry of the kings of Pergamum, who vied with
the Egyptian rulers in their encouragement of literature. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page547" id="page547"></a>547</span>
German researches in the acropolis of Pergamum between 1878
<span class="sidenote">Pergamum.</span>
and 1886 revealed four rooms which had originally been appropriated
to the library (Alex. Conze, <i>Die pergamen.
Bibliothek</i>, 1884). Despite the obstacles presented by
the embargo placed by the Ptolemies upon the export
of papyrus, the library of the Attali attained considerable
importance, and, as we have seen, when it was transported
to Egypt numbered 200,000 vols. We learn from a notice in
Suidas that in 221 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> Antiochus the Great summoned the poet
and grammarian Euphorion of Chalcis to be his librarian.</p>

<p>The early Romans were far too warlike and practical a people
to devote much attention to literature, and it is not until the
last century of the republic that we hear of libraries
in Rome. The collections of Carthage, which fell into
<span class="sidenote">Rome.</span>
their hands when Scipio sacked that city (146 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), had no
attractions for them; and with the exception of the writings of
Mago upon agriculture, which the senate reserved for translation
into Latin, they bestowed all the books upon the kinglets of
Africa (Pliny, <i>H.N.</i> xviii. 5). It is in accordance with the
military character of the Romans that the first considerable
collections of which we hear in Rome were brought there as the
spoils of war. The first of these was that brought by Aemilius
Paulus from Macedonia after the conquest of Perseus (167 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>).
The library of the conquered monarch was all that he reserved
from the prizes of victory for himself and his sons, who were fond
of letters. Next came the library of Apellicon the Teian, brought
from Athens by Sulla (86 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>). This passed at his death into
the hands of his son, but of its later history nothing is known.
The rich stores of literature brought home by Lucullus from his
eastern conquests (about 67 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) were freely thrown open to his
friends and to men of letters. Accordingly his library and the
neighbouring walks were much resorted to, especially by Greeks.
It was now becoming fashionable for rich men to furnish their
libraries well, and the fashion prevailed until it became the
subject of Seneca&rsquo;s scorn and Lucian&rsquo;s wit. The zeal of Cicero
and Atticus in adding to their collections is well known to every
reader of the classics. Tyrannion is said to have had 30,000 vols.
of his own; and that M. Terentius Varro had large collections
we may infer from Cicero&rsquo;s writing to him: &ldquo;Si hortum in
bibliotheca habes, nihil deerit.&rdquo; Not to prolong the list of
private collectors, Serenus Sammonicus is said to have left to
his pupil the young Gordian no less than 62,000 vols. Amongst
the numerous projects entertained by Caesar was that of presenting
Rome with public libraries, though it is doubtful whether
any steps were actually taken towards its execution. The task
of collecting and arranging the books was entrusted to Varro.
This commission, as well as his own fondness for books, may
have led Varro to write the book upon libraries of which a few
words only have come down to us, preserved by a grammarian.
The honour of being the first actually to dedicate a library to
the public is said by Pliny and Ovid to have fallen to G. Asinius
Pollio, who erected a library in the Atrium Libertatis on Mount
Aventine, defraying the cost from the spoils of his Illyrian
campaign. The library of Pollio was followed by the public
libraries established by Augustus. That emperor, who did so
much for the embellishment of the city, erected two libraries,
the Octavian and the Palatine. The former was founded
(33 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) in honour of his sister, and was placed in the Porticus
Octaviae, a magnificent structure, the lower part of which served
as a promenade, while the upper part contained the library.
The charge of the books was committed to C. Melissus. The
other library formed by Augustus was attached to the temple of
Apollo on the Palatine hill, and appears from inscriptions to
have consisted of two departments, a Greek and a Latin one,
which seem to have been separately administered. The charge
of the Palatine collections was given to Pompeius Macer, who
was succeeded by Julius Hyginus, the grammarian and friend of
Ovid. The Octavian library perished in the fire which raged
at Rome for three days in the reign of Titus. The Palatine was,
at all events in great part, destroyed by fire in the reign of
Commodus. The story that its collections were destroyed by
order of Pope Gregory the Great in the 6th century is now
generally rejected. The successors of Augustus, though they
did not equal him in their patronage of learning, maintained the
tradition of forming libraries. Tiberius, his immediate successor,
established one in his splendid house on the Palatine, to
which Gellius refers as the &ldquo;Tiberian library,&rdquo; and Suetonius
relates that he caused the writings and images of his favourite
Greek poets to be placed in the public libraries. Vespasian
established a library in the Temple of Peace erected after the
burning of the city under Nero. Domitian restored the libraries
which had been destroyed in the same conflagration, procuring
books from every quarter, and even sending to Alexandria to
have copies made. He is also said to have founded the Capitoline
library, though others give the credit to Hadrian. The most
famous and important of the imperial libraries, however, was
that created by Ulpius Trajanus, known as the Ulpian library,
which was first established in the Forum of Trajan, but was
afterwards removed to the baths of Diocletian. In this library
were deposited by Trajan the &ldquo;libri lintei&rdquo; and &ldquo;libri elephantini,&rdquo;
upon which the senatus consulta and other transactions
relating to the emperors were written. The library of
Domitian, which had been destroyed by fire in the reign of
Commodus, was restored by Gordian, who added to it the books
bequeathed to him by Serenus Sammonicus. Altogether in the
4th century there are said to have been twenty-eight public
libraries in Rome.</p>

<p>Nor were public libraries confined to Rome. We possess
records of at least 24 places in Italy, the Grecian provinces,
Asia Minor, Cyprus and Africa in which libraries had
been established, most of them attached to temples,
<span class="sidenote">Roman provincial libraries.</span>
usually through the liberality of generous individuals.
The library which the younger Pliny dedicated to his
townsmen at Comum cost a million sesterces and he contributed
a large sum to the support of a library at Milan. Hadrian
established one at Athens, described by Pausanias, and recently
identified with a building called the Stoa of Hadrian, which
shows a striking similarity with the precinct of Athena at
Pergamum. Strabo mentions a library at Smyrna; Aulus
Gellius one at Patrae and another at Tibur from which books
could be borrowed. Recent discoveries at Ephesus in Asia
Minor and Timegad in Algeria have furnished precise information
as to the structural plan of these buildings. The library at
Ephesus was founded by T. Julius Aquila Polemaeanus in
memory of his father, pro-consul of Asia in the time of Trajan,
about <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 106-107. The library at Timegad was established at
a cost of 400,000 sesterces by M. Julius Quintianus Flavius
Rogatianus, who probably lived in the 3rd century (R. Cagnat,
&ldquo;Les Bibliothèques municipales dans l&rsquo;Empire Romain,&rdquo; 1906,
<i>Mém. de l&rsquo;Acad. des Insc.</i>, tom. xxxviii. pt. 1). At Ephesus
the light came through a circular opening in the roof; the
library at Timegad greatly resembles that discovered at Pompeii
and possesses a system of book stores. All these buildings
followed the same general plan, consisting of a reading-room and
more or less ample book stores; the former was either rectangular
or semi-circular in shape and was approached under a
stately portico and colonnade. In a niche facing the entrance a
statue was always erected; that formerly at Pergamum&mdash;a
figure of Minerva&mdash;is now preserved at Berlin. From a well-known
line of Juvenal (<i>Sat.</i> iii. 219) we may assume that a statue
of the goddess was usually placed in libraries. The reading-room
was also ornamented with busts or life-sized images of
celebrated writers. The portraits or authors were also painted
on medallions on the presses (<i>armaria</i>) in which the books or rolls
were preserved as in the library of Isidore of Seville; sometimes
these medallions decorated the walls, as in a private library
discovered by Lanciani in 1883 at Rome (<i>Ancient Rome</i>, 1888,
p. 193). Movable seats, known to us by pictorial representations,
were in use. The books were classified, and the presses (framed
of precious woods and highly ornamented) were numbered to
facilitate reference from the catalogues. A private library
discovered at Herculaneum contained 1756 MSS. placed on
shelves round the room to a height of about 6 ft. with a central
press. In the public rooms some of the books were arranged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page548" id="page548"></a>548</span>
in the reading-room and some in the adjacent book stores.
The Christian libraries of later foundation closely followed the
classical prototypes not only in their structure but also in
smaller details. The general appearance of a Roman library
is preserved in the library of the Vatican fitted up by Sextus V.
in 1587 with painted presses, busts and antique vases.</p>

<p>As the number of libraries in Rome increased, the librarian,
who was generally a slave or freedman, became a recognized
public functionary. The names of several librarians are preserved
to us in inscriptions, including that of C. Hymenaeus,
who appears to have fulfilled the double function of physician
and librarian to Augustus. The general superintendence of the
public libraries was committed to a special official. Thus from
Nero to Trajan, Dionysius, an Alexandrian rhetorician, discharged
this function. Under Hadrian it was entrusted to his
former tutor C. Julius Vestinus, who afterwards became administrator
of the Museum at Alexandria.</p>

<p>When the seat of empire was removed by Constantine to
his new capital upon the Bosporus, the emperor established a
collection there, in which Christian literature was
probably admitted for the first time into an imperial
<span class="sidenote">Constantinople.</span>
library. Diligent search was made after the Christian
books which had been doomed to destruction by Diocletian.
Even at the death of Constantine, however, the number of books
which had been brought together amounted only to 6900. The
smallness of the number, it has been suggested, seems to show
that Constantine&rsquo;s library was mainly intended as a repository
of Christian literature. However this may be, the collection
was greatly enlarged by some of Constantine&rsquo;s successors,
especially by Julian and Theodosius, at whose death it is said
to have increased to 100,000 vols. Julian, himself a close student
and voluminous writer, though he did his best to discourage
learning among the Christians, and to destroy their libraries,
not only augmented the library at Constantinople, but founded
others, including one at Nisibis, which was soon afterwards destroyed
by fire. From the Theodosian code we learn that in
the time of that emperor a staff of seven copyists was attached
to the library at Constantinople under the direction of the
librarian. The library was burnt under the emperor Zeno in
477, but was again restored.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, as Christianity made its way and a distinctively
Christian literature grew up, the institution of libraries became
part of the ecclesiastical organization. Bishop Alexander (d. <span class="scs">A.D.</span>
250) established a church library at Jerusalem, and it became
the rule to attach to every church a collection necessary for the
inculcation of Christian doctrine. There were libraries at Cirta,
at Constantinople and at Rome. The basilica of St Lawrence at
Rome contained a library or <i>archivum</i> founded by Pope Damasus
at the end of the 4th century. Most of these collections were
housed in the sacred edifices and consisted largely of copies of
the Holy Scriptures, liturgical volumes and works of devotion.
They also included the <i>Gesta Martyrum</i> and <i>Matriculae Pauperum</i>
and official correspondence. Many of the basilicas had the apse
subdivided into three smaller hemicycles, one of which contained
the library (Lanciani, op. cit. p. 187). The largest of these
libraries, that founded by Pamphilus (d. <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 309) at Caesarea,
and said to have been increased by Eusebius, the historian of
the church, to 30,000 vols., is frequently mentioned by St
Jerome. St Augustine bequeathed his collection to the library
of the church at Hippo, which was fortunate enough to escape
destruction at the hands of the Vandals. The hermit communities
of the Egyptian deserts formed organizations which
developed into the later monastic orders of Western Europe and
the accumulation of books for the brethren was one of their
cares.</p>

<p>The removal of the capital to Byzantium was in its result
a serious blow to literature. Henceforward the science and
learning of the East and West were divorced. The libraries
of Rome ceased to collect the writings of the Greeks, while the
Greek libraries had never cared much to collect Latin literature.
The influence of the church became increasingly hostile to the
study of pagan letters. The repeated irruptions of the barbarians
soon swept the old learning and libraries alike from the soil of
Italy. With the close of the Western empire in 476 the ancient
history of libraries may be said to cease.</p>

<p class="pt2 center"><span class="sc">Medieval Period</span></p>

<p>During the first few centuries after the fall of the Western
empire, literary activity at Constantinople had fallen to its
lowest ebb. In the West, amidst the general neglect
of learning and literature, the collecting of books,
<span class="sidenote">Gaul.</span>
though not wholly forgotten, was cared for by few. Sidonius
Apollinaris tells us of the libraries of several private collectors in
Gaul. Publius Consentius possessed a library at his villa near
Narbonne which was due to the labour of three generations.
The most notable of these appears to have been the prefect
Tonantius Ferreolus, who had formed in his villa of Prusiana,
near Nîmes, a collection which his friend playfully compares to
that of Alexandria. The Goths, who had been introduced to the
Scriptures in their own language by Ulfilas in the 4th century,
began to pay some attention to Latin literature. Cassiodorus,
the favourite minister of Theodoric, was a collector as well as
an author, and on giving up the cares of government retired to a
monastery which he founded in Calabria, where he employed
his monks in the transcription of books.</p>

<p>Henceforward the charge of books as well as of education fell
more and more exclusively into the hands of the church. While
the old schools of the rhetoricians died out new monasteries
arose everywhere. Knowledge was no longer pursued for its
own sake, but became subsidiary to religious and theological
teaching. The proscription of the old classical literature, which
is symbolized in the fable of the destruction of the Palatine
library by Gregory the Great, was only too effectual. The
Gregorian tradition of opposition to pagan learning long continued
to dominate the literary pursuits of the monastic orders
and the labours of the scriptorium.</p>

<p>During the 6th and 7th centuries the learning which had
been driven from the Continent took refuge in the British Islands,
where it was removed from the political disturbances
of the mainland. In the Irish monasteries during this
<span class="sidenote">Alcuin.</span>
period there appear to have been many books, and the Venerable
Bede was superior to any scholar of his age. Theodore of Tarsus
brought a considerable number of books to Canterbury from
Rome in the 7th century, including several Greek authors. The
library of York, which was founded by Archbishop Egbert, was
almost more famous than that of Canterbury. The verses are
well known in which Alcuin describes the extensive library
under his charge, and the long list of authors whom he enumerates
is superior to that of any other library possessed by either
England or France in the 12th century, when it was unhappily
burnt. The inroads of the Northmen in the 9th and 10th
centuries had been fatal to the monastic libraries on both sides
of the channel. It was from York that Alcuin came to Charlemagne
to superintend the school attached to his palace; and it
was doubtless inspired by Alcuin that Charles issued the memorable
document which enjoined that in the bishoprics and
monasteries within his realm care should be taken that there
shall be not only a regular manner of life, but also the study of
letters. When Alcuin finally retired from the court to the abbacy
of Tours, there to carry out his own theory of monastic discipline
and instruction, he wrote to Charles for leave to send to York
for copies of the books of which they had so much need at
Tours. While Alcuin thus increased the library at Tours,
<span class="sidenote">Charlemagne.</span>
Charlemagne enlarged that at Fulda, which had been
founded in 774, and which all through the middle ages
stood in great respect. Lupus Servatus, a pupil of
Hrabanus Maurus at Fulda, and afterwards abbot of Ferrières,
was a devoted student of the classics and a great collector of
books. His correspondence illustrates the difficulties which
then attended the study of literature through the paucity and
dearness of books, the declining care for learning, and the increasing
troubles of the time. Nor were private collections of
books altogether wanting during the period in which Charlemagne
and his successors laboured to restore the lost traditions of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page549" id="page549"></a>549</span>
liberal education and literature. Pepin le Bref had indeed met
with scanty response to the request for books which he addressed
to the pontiff Paul I. Charlemagne, however, collected a considerable
number of choice books for his private use in two
places. Although these collections were dispersed at his death,
his son Louis formed a library which continued to exist under
Charles the Bald. About the same time Everard, count of Friuli,
formed a considerable collection which he bequeathed to a
monastery. But the greatest private collector of the middle
ages was doubtless Gerbert, Pope Sylvester II., who showed the
utmost zeal and spent large sums in collecting books, not only
in Rome and Italy, but from Germany, Belgium and even from
Spain.</p>

<p>The hopes of a revival of secular literature fell with the decline
of the schools established by Charles and his successors. The
knowledge of letters remained the prerogative of the
church, and for the next four or five centuries the
<span class="sidenote">St. Benedict.</span>
collecting and multiplication of books were almost
entirely confined to the monasteries. Several of the greater
orders made these an express duty; this was especially the case
with the Benedictines. It was the first care of St Benedict,
we are told, that in each newly founded monastery there should
be a library, &ldquo;et velut curia quaedam illustrium auctorum.&rdquo;
Monte Cassino became the starting-point of a long line of institutions
which were destined to be the centres of religion and
of literature. It must indeed be remembered that literature in
the sense of St Benedict meant Biblical and theological works,
the lives of the saints and martyrs, and the lives and writings of
the fathers. Of the reformed Benedictine orders the Carthusians
and the Cistercians were those most devoted to literary pursuits.
The abbeys of Fleury, of Melk and of St Gall were remarkable
for the splendour of their libraries. In a later age the labours of
the congregation of St Maur form one of the most striking
chapters in the history of learning. The Augustinians and the
Dominicans rank next to the Benedictines in their care for
literature. The libraries of St Geneviève and St Victor, belonging
to the former, were amongst the largest of the monastic
collections. Although their poverty might seem to put them at
a disadvantage as collectors, the mendicant orders cultivated
literature with much assiduity, and were closely connected with
the intellectual movement to which the universities owed their
rise. In England Richard of Bury praises them for their extraordinary
diligence in collecting books. Sir Richard Whittington
built a large library for the Grey Friars in London, and they
possessed considerable libraries at Oxford.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to attempt here an account of all
the libraries established by the monastic orders. We must be
content to enumerate a few of the most eminent.</p>

<p>In Italy Monte Cassino is a striking example of the dangers
and vicissitudes to which monastic collections were exposed.
Ruined by the Lombards in the 6th century, the
monastery was rebuilt and a library established, to
<span class="sidenote">Monastic libraries.</span>
fall a prey to Saracens and to fire in the 9th. The
collection then reformed survived many other chances and
changes, and still exists. Boccaccio gives a melancholy description
of its condition in his day. It affords a conspicuous
example of monastic industry in the transcription not only of
theological but also of classical works. The library of Bobbio,
which owed its existence to Irish monks, was famous for its
palimpsests. The collection, of which a catalogue of the 10th
century is given by Muratori (<i>Antiq. Ital. Med. Aev.</i> iii. 817-824),
was mainly transferred to the Ambrosian library at Milan. Of
the library of Pomposia, near Ravenna, Montfaucon has printed
a catalogue dating from the 11th century (<i>Diarium Italicum</i>,
chap. xxii.).</p>

<p>Of the monastic libraries of France the principal were those of
Fleury, of Cluny, of St Riquier and of Corbie. At Fleury
Abbot Macharius in 1146 imposed a contribution for library
purposes upon the officers of the community and its dependencies,
an example which was followed elsewhere. After many vicissitudes,
its MSS., numbering 238, were deposited in 1793 in the
town library of Orleans. The library of St Riquier in the time
of Louis the Pious contained 256 MSS., with over 500 works.
Of the collection at Corbie in Picardy we have also catalogues
dating from the 12th and from the 17th centuries. Corbie was
famous for the industry of its transcribers, and appears to have
stood in active literary intercourse with other monasteries. In
1638, 400 of its choicest manuscripts were removed to St Germain-des-Prés.
The remainder were removed after 1794, partly to
the national library at Paris, partly to the town library of
Amiens.</p>

<p>The chief monastic libraries of Germany were at Fulda, Corvey,
Reichenau and Sponheim. The library at Fulda owed much to
Charlemagne and to its abbot Hrabanus Maurus. Under Abbot
Sturmius four hundred monks were hired as copyists. In 1561
the collection numbered 774 volumes. The library of Corvey
on the Weser, after being despoiled of some of its treasures in the
Reformation age, was presented to the university of Marburg in
1811. It then contained 109 vols., with 400 or 500 titles. The
library of Reichenau, of which several catalogues are extant,
fell a prey to fire and neglect, and its ruin was consummated by
the Thirty Years&rsquo; War. The library of Sponheim owes its great
renown to John Tritheim, who was abbot at the close of the
15th century. He found it reduced to 10 vols., and left it with
upwards of 2000 at his retirement. The library at St Gall,
formed as early as 816 by Gozbert, its second abbot, still exists.</p>

<p>In England the principal collections were those of Canterbury,
York, Wearmouth, Jarrow, Whitby, Glastonbury, Croyland,
Peterborough and Durham. Of the library of
the monastery of Christ Church, Canterbury, originally
<span class="sidenote">England.</span>
founded by Augustine and Theodore, and restored by Lanfranc
and Anselm, a catalogue has been preserved dating from the 13th
or 14th century, and containing 698 volumes, with about 3000
works. Bennet Biscop, the first abbot of Wearmouth, made five
journeys to Rome, and on each occasion returned with a store of
books for the library. It was destroyed by the Danes about
867. Of the library at Whitby there is a catalogue dating from
the 12th century. The catalogue of Glastonbury has been
printed by Hearne in his edition of John of Glastonbury. When
the library of Croyland perished by fire in 1091 it contained about
700 vols. The library at Peterborough was also rich; from a
catalogue of about the end of the 14th century it had 344 vols.,
with nearly 1700 titles. The catalogues of the library at the
monastery of Durham have been printed by the Surtees Society,
and form an interesting series. These catalogues with many
others<a name="fa8j" id="fa8j" href="#ft8j"><span class="sp">8</span></a> afford abundant evidence of the limited character of
the monkish collections, whether we look at the number of their
volumes or at the nature of their contents. The scriptoria were
manufactories of books and not centres of learning. That in
spite of the labours of so many transcribers the costliness and
scarcity of books remained so great may have been partly, but
cannot have been wholly, due to the scarcity of writing materials.
It may be suspected that indolence and carelessness were the
rule in most monasteries, and that but few of the monks keenly
realized the whole force of the sentiment expressed by one of
their number in the 12th century&mdash;&ldquo;Claustrum sine armario
quasi castrum sine armamentario.&rdquo; Nevertheless it must be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page550" id="page550"></a>550</span>
admitted that to the labours of the monastic transcribers we are
indebted for the preservation of Latin literature.</p>

<p>The subject of the evolution of the arrangement of library
rooms and fittings as gradually developed throughout medieval
Europe should not be passed over.<a name="fa9j" id="fa9j" href="#ft9j"><span class="sp">9</span></a> The real origin
of library organization in the Christian world, one may
<span class="sidenote">The development of library arrangements.</span>
almost say the origin of modern library methods,
began with the rule of St Benedict early in the 6th
century. In the 48th chapter the monks were ordered
to borrow a book apiece and to read it straight through.
There was no special apartment for the books in the primitive
Benedictine house. After the books became too numerous to
be kept in the church they were preserved in <i>armaria</i>, or chests,
in the cloister; hence the word <i>armarius</i>, the Benedictine
librarian, who at first joined with it the office of precentor.
The Benedictine regulations were developed in the stricter observances
of the Cluniacs, which provided for a kind of annual report
and stocktaking. The Carthusians were perhaps the first to lend
books away from the convent; and the Cistercians to possess a
separate library official as well as a room specially devoted to
books. The observances of the Augustinians contained rules for
the binding, repairing, cataloguing and arranging the books by
the librarian, as well as a prescription of the exact kind of chest
to be used. Among the Premonstratensians or Reformed
Augustinians, it was one of the duties of the librarian to provide
for the borrowing of books elsewhere for the use of the monks.
The Mendicant Friars found books so necessary that at last
Richard de Bury tells us with some exaggeration that their
libraries exceeded all others. Many volumes still exist which
belonged to the library at Assisi, the parent house of the Franciscans,
of which a catalogue was drawn up in 1381. No authentic
monastic bookcase can now be found; the doubtful example
shown at Bayeux probably contained ecclesiastical utensils.
At the Augustinian priory at Barnwell the presses were lined
with wood to keep out the damp and were partitioned off both
vertically and horizontally. Sometimes there were recesses in
the walls of the cloisters fitted with shelves and closed with a
door. These recesses developed into a small windowless room
in the Cistercian houses. At Clairvaux, Kirkstall, Fountains,
Tintern, Netley and elsewhere this small chamber was placed
between the chapter-house and the transept of the church. At
Meaux in Holderness the books were lodged on shelves against
the walls and even over the door of such a chamber. In many
houses the treasury or spendiment contained two classes of books&mdash;one
for the monks generally, others more closely guarded. A
press near the infirmary contained books used by the reader in
the refectory. By the end of the 15th century the larger
monasteries became possessed of many volumes and found
themselves obliged to store the books, hitherto placed in various
parts of the building, in a separate apartment. We now find
libraries being specially built at Canterbury, Durham, Citeaux,
Clairvaux and elsewhere, and with this specialization there grew
up increased liberality in the use of books and learned strangers
were admitted. Even at an early date students were permitted
to borrow from the Benedictines at St Germain-des-Prés at Paris,
of which a later foundation owned in 1513 a noble library
erected over the south wall of the cloister, and enlarged and made
very accessible to the outer world in the 17th and 18th centuries.
The methods and fittings of college libraries of early foundation
closely resembled those of the monastic libraries. There was
in both the annual giving out and inspection of what we would
now call the lending department for students; while the books,
fastened by chains&mdash;a kind of reference department kept in the
library chamber for the common use of the fellows&mdash;followed a
similar system in monastic institutions. By the 15th century
collegiate and monastic libraries were on the same plan, with
the separate room containing books placed on their sides on
desks or lecterns, to which they were attached by chains to a
horizontal bar. As the books increased the accommodation was
augmented by one or two shelves erected above the desks. The
library at Cesena in North Italy may still be seen in its original
condition. The Laurentian library at Florence was designed by
Michelangelo on the monastic model. Another good example
of the old form may be seen, in the library of Merton College at
Oxford, a long narrow room with bookcases standing between
the windows at right angles to the walls. In the chaining
system one end was attached to the wooden cover of the book
while the other ran freely on a bar fixed by a method of double
locks to the front of the shelf or desk on which the book rested.
The fore edges of the volumes faced the reader. The seat and
shelf were sometimes combined. Low cases were subsequently
introduced between the higher cases, and the seat replaced by a
step. Shelf lists were placed at the end of each case. There
were no chains in the library of the Escorial, erected in 1584,
which showed for the first time bookcases placed against the
walls. Although chains were no longer part of the appliances
in the newly erected libraries they continued to be used and
were ordered in bequests in England down to the early part of
the 18th century. Triple desks and revolving lecterns, raised
by a wooden screw, formed part of the library furniture. The
English cathedral libraries were fashioned after the same principle.
The old methods were fully reproduced in the fittings at Westminster,
erected at a late date. Here we may see books on shelves
against the walls as well as in cases at right angles to the walls;
the desk-like shelves for the chained volumes (no longer in
existence) have a slot in which the chains could be suspended,
and are hinged to allow access to shelves below. An ornamental
wooden tablet at the end of each case is a survival of the old
shelf list. By the end of the 17th century the type of the public
library developed from collegiate and monastic prototypes,
became fixed as it were throughout Europe (H. R. Tedder,
&ldquo;Evolution of the Public Library,&rdquo; in <i>Trans. of 2nd Int. Library
Conference</i>, 1897, 1898).</p>

<p>The first conquests of the Arabians, as we have already seen,
threatened hostility to literature. But, as soon as their conquests
were secured, the caliphs became the patrons
of learning and science. Greek manuscripts were
<span class="sidenote">Arabians.</span>
eagerly sought for and translated into Arabic, and colleges
and libraries everywhere arose. Baghdad in the east and Cordova
in the west became the seats of a rich development of
letters and science during the age when the civilization of Europe
was most obscured. Cairo and Tripoli were also distinguished
for their libraries. The royal library of the Fatimites in Africa
is said to have numbered 100,000 manuscripts, while that collected
by the Omayyads of Spain is reported to have contained
six times as many. It is said that there were no less than seventy
libraries opened in the cities of Andalusia. Whether these
figures be exaggerated or not&mdash;and they are much below those
given by some Arabian writers, which are undoubtedly so&mdash;it is
certain that the libraries of the Arabians and the Moors of Spain
offer a very remarkable contrast to those of the Christian nations
during the same period.<a name="fa10j" id="fa10j" href="#ft10j"><span class="sp">10</span></a></p>

<p>The literary and scientific activity of the Arabians appears
to have been the cause of a revival of letters amongst the Greeks
of the Byzantine empire in the 9th century. Under
Leo the Philosopher and Constantine Porphyrogenitus
<span class="sidenote">Renaissance.</span>
the libraries of Constantinople awoke into renewed life.
The compilations of such writers as Stobaeus, Photius and
Suidas, as well as the labours of innumerable critics and commentators,
bear witness to the activity, if not to the lofty
character of the pursuits, of the Byzantine scholars. The
labours of transcription were industriously pursued in the
libraries and in the monasteries of Mount Athos and the Aegean,
and it was from these quarters that the restorers of learning
brought into Italy so many Greek manuscripts. In this way
many of the treasures of ancient literature had been already
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page551" id="page551"></a>551</span>
conveyed to the West before the fate which overtook the libraries
of Constantinople on the fall of the city in 1453.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in the West, with the reviving interest in literature
which already marks the 14th century, we find arising outside
the monasteries a taste for collecting books. St Louis of France
and his successors had formed small collections, none of which
survived its possessor. It was reserved for Charles V. to form
a considerable library which he intended to be permanent.
In 1373 he had amassed 910 volumes, and had a catalogue of them
prepared, from which we see that it included a good deal of the
new sort of literature. In England Guy, earl of Warwick,
formed a curious collection of French romances, which he
bequeathed to Bordesley Abbey on his death in 1315. Richard
d&rsquo;Aungervyle of Bury, the author of the <i>Philobiblon</i>, amassed a
noble collection of books, and had special opportunities of
doing so as Edward III.&rsquo;s chancellor and ambassador. He
founded Durham College at Oxford, and equipped it with a
library a hundred years before Humphrey, duke of Gloucester,
made his benefaction of books to the university. The taste for
secular literature, and the enthusiasm for the ancient classics,
gave a fresh direction to the researches of collectors. A disposition
to encourage literature began to show itself amongst the
great. This was most notable amongst the Italian princes.
Cosimo de&rsquo; Medici formed a library at Venice while living there
in exile in 1433, and on his return to Florence laid the foundation
of the great Medicean library. The honour of establishing the
first modern public library in Italy had been already secured by
Niccolo Niccoli, who left his library of over 800 volumes for the use
of the public on his death in 1436. Frederick, duke of Urbino,
collected all the writings in Greek and Latin which he could
procure, and we have an interesting account of his collection
written by his first librarian, Vespasiano. The ardour for
classical studies led to those active researches for the Latin
writers who were buried in the monastic libraries which are
especially identified with the name of Poggio. For some time
before the fall of Constantinople, the perilous state of the
Eastern empire had driven many Greek scholars from that capital
into western Europe, where they had directed the studies and
formed the taste of the zealous students of the Greek language
and literature. The enthusiasm of the Italian princes extended
itself beyond the Alps. Matthias Corvinus, king of Hungary,
amassed a collection of splendidly executed and magnificently
bound manuscripts, which at his death are said to have reached
the almost incredible number of 50,000 vols. The library was
not destined long to survive its founder. There is reason to
believe that it had been very seriously despoiled even before it
perished at the hands of the Turks on the fall of Buda in 1527.
A few of its treasures are still preserved in some of the libraries
of Europe. While these munificent patrons of learning were
thus taking pains to recover and multiply the treasures of
ancient literature by the patient labour of transcribers and
calligraphers, an art was being elaborated which was destined
to revolutionize the whole condition of literature and libraries.
With the invention of printing, so happily coinciding with the
revival of true learning and sound science, the modern history
of libraries may be said to begin.</p>

<p class="pt2 center"><span class="sc">Modern Libraries</span></p>

<p>In most of the European countries and in the United States
libraries of all kinds have during the last twenty years been
undergoing a process of development and improvement which
has greatly altered their policy and methods. At one time
libraries were regarded almost entirely as repositories for the
storage of books to be used by the learned alone, but now they
are coming to be regarded more and more as workshops or as
places for intellectual recreation adapted for every department
of life. This is particularly to be found as the ideal in
the public libraries of the Anglo-Saxon races throughout the
world.</p>

<p>The following details comprise the chief points in the history,
equipment and methods of the various libraries and systems
noticed.</p>

<p class="pt1 center"><i>The United Kingdom.</i></p>

<p><i>State Libraries.</i>&mdash;The British Museum ranks in importance
before all the great libraries of the world, and excels in the
arrangement and accessibility of its contents. The
library consists of over 2,000,000 printed volumes
<span class="sidenote">British Museum.</span>
and 56,000 manuscripts, but this large total does
not include pamphlets and other small publications which are
usually counted in other libraries. Adding these together it is
probable that over 5,000,000 items are comprised in the collections.
This extraordinary opulence is principally due to the
enlightened energy of Sir Anthony Panizzi (<i>q.v.</i>). The number
of volumes in the printed book department, when he took the
keepership in 1837, was only 240,000; and during the nineteen
years he held that office about 400,000 were added, mostly by
purchase, under his advice and direction. It was Panizzi likewise
who first seriously set to work to see that the national
library reaped all the benefits bestowed upon it by the Copyright
Act.</p>

<p>The foundation of the British Museum dates from 1753, when
effect was given to the bequest (in exchange for £20,000 to be
paid to his executors) by Sir Hans Sloane, of his books, manuscripts,
curiosities, &amp;c., to be held by trustees for the use of the
nation. A bill was passed through parliament for the purchase
of the Sloane collections and of the Harleian MSS., costing
£10,000. To these, with the Cottonian MSS., acquired by the
country in 1700, was added by George II., in 1757, the royal
library of the former kings of England, coupled with the privilege,
which that library had for many years enjoyed, of obtaining
a copy of every publication entered at Stationers&rsquo; Hall. This
addition was of the highest importance, as it enriched the
museum with the old collections of Archbishop Cranmer, Henry
prince of Wales, and other patrons of literature, while the transfer
of the privilege with regard to the acquisition of new books, a
right which has been maintained by successive Copyright Acts,
secured a large and continuous augmentation. A lottery having
been authorized to defray the expenses of purchases, as well as
for providing suitable accommodation, the museum and library
were established in Montague House, and opened to the public
15th January 1759. In 1763 George III. presented the well-known
Thomason collection (in 2220 volumes) of books and
pamphlets issued in England between 1640 and 1662, embracing
all the controversial literature which appeared during that period.
The Rev. C. M. Cracherode, one of the trustees, bequeathed his
collection of choice books in 1799; and in 1820 Sir Joseph Banks
left to the nation his important library of 16,000 vols. Many
other libraries have since then been incorporated in the museum,
the most valuable being George III.&rsquo;s royal collection (15,000
vols. of tracts, and 65,259 vols. of printed books, including
many of the utmost rarity, which had cost the king about
£130,000), which was presented (for a pecuniary consideration,
it has been said) by George IV. in 1823, and that of the Right
Honourable Thomas Grenville (20,240 vols. of rare books, all in
fine condition and binding), which was acquired under bequest
in 1846. The Cracherode, Banksian, King&rsquo;s and Grenville
libraries are still preserved as separate collections. Other
libraries of minor note have also been absorbed in a similar way,
while, at least since the time of Panizzi, no opportunity has been
neglected of making useful purchases at all the British and
Continental book auctions.</p>

<p>The collection of English books is far from approaching
completeness, but, apart from the enormous number of volumes,
the library contains an extraordinary quantity of rarities. Few
libraries in the United States equal either in number or value the
American books in the museum. The collection of Slavonic
literature, due to the initiative of Thomas Watts, is also a remarkable
feature. Indeed, in cosmopolitan interest the museum
is without a rival in the world, possessing as it does the best
library in any European language out of the territory in which
the language is vernacular. The Hebrew, the Chinese, and
printed books in other Oriental languages are important and
represented in large numbers. Periodical literature has not been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page552" id="page552"></a>552</span>
forgotten, and the series of newspapers is of great extent and
interest. Great pains are taken by the authorities to obtain
the copies of the newspapers published in the United Kingdom
to which they are entitled by the provisions of the Copyright
Act, and upwards of 3400 are annually collected, filed and
bound.</p>

<p>The department of MSS. is almost equal In importance to that
of the printed books. The collection of MSS. in European
languages ranges from the 3rd century before Christ down to our
own times, and includes the <i>Codex Alexandrinus</i> of the Bible.
The old historical chronicles of England, the charters of the
Anglo-Saxon kings, and the celebrated series of Arthurian
romances are well represented; and care has been taken to
acquire on every available opportunity the imprinted works of
English writers. The famous collections of MSS. made by Sir
Robert Cotton and Robert Harley, earl of Oxford, have already
been mentioned, and from these and other sources the museum
has become rich in early Anglo-Saxon and Latin codices, some of
them being marvels of skill in calligraphy and ornamentation,
such as the charters of King Edgar and Henry I. to Hyde Abbey,
which are written in gold letters; or the Lindisfarne gospels
(<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 700) containing the earliest extant Anglo-Saxon version
of the Latin gospels. The Burney collection of classical MSS.
furnished important additions, so that from this source and
from the collection of Arundel MSS. (transferred from the Royal
Society in 1831), the museum can boast of an early copy of the
<i>Iliad</i>, and one of the earliest known codices of the <i>Odyssey</i>.
Among the unrivalled collection of Greek papyri are the unique
MSS. of several works of ancient literature. Irish, French and
Italian MSS. are well represented. Special reference may be
made to the celebrated Bedford Hours, illuminated for the duke
of Bedford, regent of France, to the Sforza Book of Hours
and to Queen Mary&rsquo;s Psalter. The Oriental collection is also
extremely valuable, including the library formed by Mr Rich
(consul at Baghdad in the early part of the 19th century), and a
vast quantity of Arabic, Persian and Turkish MSS.; the Chambers
collection of Sanskrit MSS.; several other collections of Indian
MSS.; and a copious library of Hebrew MSS. (including that of
the great scholar Michaelis, and codices of great age, recently
brought from Yemen). The collection of Syriac MSS., embracing
the relics of the famous library of the convent of St Mary
Deipara in the Nitrian desert, formed by the abbot Moses of
Nisibis, in the 10th century, is the most important in existence;
of the large store of Abyssinian volumes many were amassed
after the campaign against King Theodore. The number of
genealogical rolls and documents relating to the local and family
history of Great Britain is very large. Altogether there are
now more than 56,000 MSS. (of which over 9000 are Oriental),
besides more than 75,000 charters and rolls. There is a very
large and valuable collection of printed and manuscript
music of all kinds, and it is probable that of separate pieces
there are nearly 200,000. The catalogue of music is partly
in manuscript and partly printed, and a separate printed
catalogue of the MS. music has been published. The number
of maps is also very large, and a printed catalogue has been

<p>The general catalogue of the printed books was at one time kept
in MS. in large volumes, but since 1880 the entries have gradually
been superseded by the printed titles forming part of the large
alphabetical catalogue which was completed in 1900. This important
work is arranged in the order of authors&rsquo; names, with
occasional special entries at words like Bible, periodicals and biographical
names. It is being constantly supplemented and forms an
invaluable bibliographical work of reference.</p>

<p>The other printed catalogues of books commence with one published
in 2 vols. folio (1787), followed by that of 1813-1819 in 7 vols. 8vo;
the next is that of the library of George III. (1820-1829, 5 vols. folio,
with 2 vols. 8vo, 1834), describing the geographical and topographical
collections; and then the <i>Bibliotheca Grenvilliana</i> (1842-1872, 4 vols.
8vo). The first vol. (letter A) of a general catalogue appeared in 1841
in a folio volume which has never been added to. The octavo
catalogue of the Hebrew books came out in 1867; that of the
Sanskrit and Pali literature is in 4to (1876); and the Chinese catalogue
is also in 4to (1877). There is a printed list of the books of
reference (1910) in the reading-room.</p>

<p>The printed catalogues of the MSS. are&mdash;that of the old Royal
Library (1734, 4to), which in 1910 was shortly to be superseded by
a new one; the Sloane and others hitherto undescribed (1782, 2 vols.
4to); the Cottonian (1802, folio); the Harleian (1808, 4 vols. folio);
the Hargrave (1818, 4to); the Lansdowne (1819, folio); the Arundel
(1840, folio); the Burney (1840, folio); the Stowe (1895-1896, 4to);
the Additional, in periodical volumes since 1836; the Greek Papyri
(1893-1910); the Oriental (Arabic and Ethiopic), 5 pts., folio (1838-1871);
the Syriac (1870-1873, 3 pts., 4to); the Ethiopic (1877, 4to);
the Persian (1879-1896, 4 vols. 4to); and the Spanish (1875-1893,
4 vols. 8vo); Turkish (1888); Hebrew and Samaritan (1900-1909,
3 vols.); Sanskrit (1903); Hindi, &amp;c. (1899); Sinhalese (1900).
There are also catalogues of the Greek and Egyptian papyri (1839-1846,
5 pts., folio). Many other special catalogues have been issued,
including one of the Thomason Collection of Civil War pamphlets,
Incunabula (vol. i.), Romances (MSS.), Music, Seals and Arabic,
Hebrew and other Oriental books, maps, prints and drawings.
Perhaps the most useful catalogue of all is the <i>Subject-index to Modern
Works</i> issued in 1881-1905 (4 vols.) and compiled by Mr G. K.
Fortescue.</p>

<p>The <i>Rules for compiling catalogues in the department of printed books</i>
were revised and published in 1906.</p>
</div>

<p>The building in which the library is housed forms part of the
fine group situated in Great Russell Street in central London,
and is distinguished by a stately circular reading-room designed
by Sydney Smirke from suggestions and sketches supplied by Sir
A. Panizzi. This was begun in 1855 and opened in 1857. The
room is surrounded by book stores placed in galleries with iron
floors, in which, owing to congestion of stock, various devices
have been introduced, particularly a hanging and rolling form
of auxiliary bookcase. The presses inside the reading-room,
arranged in three tiers, contain upwards of 60,000 vols., those
on the ground floor (20,000) being books of reference to which
readers have unlimited access. The accommodation for readers
is comfortable and roomy, each person having a portion of
table fitted with various conveniences. Perhaps not the least
convenient arrangement here is the presence of the staff in
the centre of the room, at the service of readers who require
aid.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In order to enjoy the privilege of reading at the British Museum,
the applicant (who must be over twenty-one years of age) must
obtain a renewable ticket of admission through a recommendation
from a householder addressed to the principal librarian.</p>

<p>The pressure upon the space at the command of the library has
been so great that additional land at the rear and sides of the existing
buildings was purchased by the government for the further extension
of the Museum. One very important wing facing Torrington
Square was nearly completed in 1910. The Natural History Museum,
South Kensington, a department of the British Museum under
separate management, has a library of books on the natural sciences
numbering nearly 100,000 vols.</p>
</div>

<p>Next in importance to the British Museum, and superior to
it in accessibility, is the Library of the Patent Office in Southampton
Buildings, London. This is a department of
the Board of Trade, and though primarily intended
<span class="sidenote">Patent Office.</span>
for office use and patentees, it is really a public library
freely open to anyone. The only formality required from
readers is a signature in a book kept in the entrance hall. After
this readers have complete access to the shelves. The library
contains considerably over 110,000 vols., and possesses complete
sets of the patents specifications of all countries, and a remarkable
collection of the technical and scientific periodicals of all
countries. The library was first opened in 1855, in somewhat
unsuitable premises, and in 1897 it was transferred to a handsome
new building.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The reading-room is provided with two galleries and the majority
of the books are open to public inspection without the need for
application forms. A printed catalogue in author-alphabetical form
has been published with supplement, and in addition, separate subject
catalogues are issued. This is one of the most complete libraries of
technology in existence, and its collection of scientific transactions
and periodicals is celebrated.</p>
</div>

<p>Another excellent special library is the National Art Library,
founded in 1841 and transferred to South Kensington in 1856.
It contains about half a million books, prints, drawings
<span class="sidenote">Other state libraries.</span>
and photographs, and is used mostly by the students
attending the art schools, though the general public
can obtain admission on payment of sixpence per week.</p>

<p>A somewhat similar library on the science side is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page553" id="page553"></a>553</span>
Science Library of the Victoria and Albert Museum, South
Kensington, which was founded in 1857. It is a general science
collection and incorporates most of the books which at one time
were in the Museum of Practical Geology.</p>

<p>The only other state library which is open to the public is
that of the Board of Education in Whitehall, which was opened
in a new building in 1908. It contains a large collection of
works on educational subjects for which a special classification
has been devised and printed.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The other state libraries in London may be briefly noted as
follows: Admiralty (1700), 40,000 vols.; College of Arms, or
Heralds College, 15,000 vols.; Colonial Office, <i>c.</i> 15,000 vols.;
Foreign Office, <i>c.</i> 80,000 vols.; Home Office (1800) <i>c.</i> 10,000 vols.;
House of Commons (1818), <i>c.</i> 50,000 vols.; House of Lords (1834),
50,000 vols.; India Office (1800), <i>c.</i> 86,000 vols.; Kew, Royal
Botanic Gardens (1853), 22,000 vols.; and Royal Observatory
(Greenwich), <i>c.</i> 20,000 vols.</p>

<p>Outside London the most important state library is the National
Library of Ireland, Dublin, founded in 1877 and incorporating the
library of the Royal Dublin Society. It is housed in a handsome
building (1890) and contains about 200,000 vols., classified on the
Decimal system, and catalogued in various forms. The library of the
Museum of Science and Art at Edinburgh, containing over 20,000
vols., was opened to the public in 1890. Practically every department
of the state has a reference library of some kind for the use of the
staff, and provision is also made for lending libraries and reading-rooms
in connexion with garrisons, naval depots and other services
of the army and navy.</p>
</div>

<p>No professional qualifications are required for positions in
British state libraries, most of the assistants being merely
second-division clerks who have passed the Civil Service examinations.
It would be an advantage from an administrative
point of view if the professional certificates of the Library
Association were adopted by the Civil Service Commissioners as
compulsory requirements in addition to their own examination.
The official recognition of a grade of properly trained librarians
would tend to improve the methods and efficiency of the state
libraries, which are generally behind the municipal libraries in
organization and administration.</p>

<p><i>University and Collegiate Libraries.</i>&mdash;The Bodleian Library,
Oxford, though it had been preceded by various efforts towards
a university library, owed its origin to Sir Thomas
Bodley (<i>q.v.</i>). Contributing largely himself, and procuring
<span class="sidenote">Oxford.</span>
contributions from others, he opened the library with
upwards of 2000 vols. in 1602. In 1610 he obtained a grant
from the Stationers&rsquo; Company of a copy of every work printed
in the country, a privilege still enjoyed under the provisions of
the various copyright acts. The additions made to the library
soon surpassed the capacity of the room, and the founder proceeded
to enlarge it. By his will he left considerable property
to the university for the maintenance and increase of the library.
The example set by Bodley found many noble imitators.
Amongst the chief benefactors have been Archbishop Laud,
the executors of Sir Kenelm Digby, John Selden, Sir Thomas
(Lord) Fairfax, Richard Gough, Francis Douce, Richard Rawlinson,
and the Rev. Robert Mason. The library now contains
almost 800,000 printed vols., and about 41,000 manuscripts.
But the number of volumes, as bound up, conveys a very inadequate
idea of the size or value of the collection. In the
department of Oriental manuscripts it is perhaps superior to
any other European library; and it is exceedingly rich in other
manuscript treasures. It possesses a splendid series of Greek
and Latin <i>editiones principes</i> and of the earliest productions of
English presses. Its historical manuscripts contain most valuable
materials for the general and literary history of the country.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The last general catalogue of the printed books was printed in
4 vols. folio (1843-1851). In 1859 it was decided to prepare a new
manuscript catalogue on the plan of that then in use at the British
Museum, and this has been completed in duplicate. In 1910 it was
being amended with a view to printing. It is an alphabetical
author-catalogue; and the Bodleian, like the British Museum, has
no complete subject-index. A slip-catalogue on subjects was, however,
in course of preparation in 1910, and there are classified
hand-lists of accessions since 1883. There are also printed catalogues
of the books belonging to several of the separate collections. The
MSS. are in general catalogued according to the collections to which
they belong, and they are all indexed. A number of the catalogues
of manuscripts have been printed.</p>
</div>

<p>In 1860 the beautiful Oxford building known as the &ldquo;Radcliffe
Library,&rdquo; now called the &ldquo;Radcliffe Camera,&rdquo; was offered to
the curators of the Bodleian by the Radcliffe trustees. The
Radcliffe Library was founded by the famous physician Dr
John Radcliffe, who died in 1714, and bequeathed, besides a
permanent endowment of £350 a year, the sum of £40,000 for
a building. The library was opened in 1749. Many years ago
the trustees resolved to confine their purchases of books to
works on medicine and natural science. When the university
museum and laboratories were built in 1860, the trustees allowed
the books to be transferred to the museum. It is used as a
storehouse for the more modern books, and it also serves as a
reading-room. It is the only room open after the hour when
the older building is closed owing to the rule as to the exclusion
of artificial light. In 1889 the gallery of the Radcliffe Camera
was opened as an addition to the reading-room.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>A <i>Staff Kalendar</i> has been issued since 1902, which with a <i>Supplement</i>
contains a complete list of cataloguing rules, routine work of the
libraries and staff, and useful information of many kinds concerning
the library methods.</p>
</div>

<p>The Bodleian Library is open by right to all graduate members
of the university, and to others upon producing a satisfactory
recommendation. No books are allowed to be sent out of the
library except by special leave of the curators and convocation
of the university. The administration and control of the library
are committed to a librarian and board of thirteen curators. The
permanent endowment is comparatively small; the ordinary
expenditure, chiefly defrayed from the university chest, is about
£10,000. Within recent years the use of wheeling metal
bookcases has been greatly extended, and a large repository
has been arranged for economical book storage underground.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The Taylor Institution is due to the benefaction of Sir Robert
Taylor, an architect, who died in 1788, leaving his property to found
an establishment for the teaching of modern languages. The library
was established in 1848, and is devoted to the literature of the modern
European languages. It contains a fair collection of works on
European philology, with a special Dante collection, about 1000
Mazarinades and 400 Luther pamphlets. The Finch collection, left
to the university in 1830, is also kept with the Taylor Library.
Books are lent out to members of the university and to others on a
proper introduction. The endowment affords an income of £800 to
£1000 for library purposes.</p>

<p>The libraries of the several colleges vary considerably in extent and
character, although, owing chiefly to limited funds, the changes and
growth of all are insignificant. That of All Souls was established in
1443 by Archbishop Chichele, and enlarged in 1710 by the munificent
bequest of Christopher Codrington. It devotes special attention to
jurisprudence, of which it has a large collection. It possesses 40,000
printed volumes and 300 MSS., and fills a splendid hall 200 ft. long.
The library of Brasenose College has a special endowment fund, so
that it has, for a college library, the unusually large income of £200.
The library of Christ Church is rich in divinity and topography. It
embraces the valuable library bequeathed by Charles Boyle, 4th
earl of Orrery, amounting to 10,000 volumes, the books and MSS.
of Archbishop Wake, and the Morris collection of Oriental books.
The building was finished in 1761, and closely resembles the basilica
of Antoninus at Rome, now the Dogana. Corpus possesses a fine
collection of Aldines, many of them presented by its founder, Bishop
Fox, and a collection of 17th-century tracts catalogued by Mr
Edwards, with about 400 MSS. Exeter College Library has 25,000
volumes, with special collections of classical dissertations and English
theological and political tracts. The library of Jesus College has few
books of later date than the early part of the last century. Many of
them are from the bequest of Sir Leoline Jenkins, who built the
existing library. There are also some valuable Welsh MSS. The
library of Keble College consists largely of theology, including the
MSS. of many of Keble&rsquo;s works. The library of Magdalen College
has about 22,500 volumes (including many volumes of pamphlets)
and 250 MSS. It has scientific and topographical collections. The
library of Merton College has of late devoted itself to foreign modern
history. New College Library has about 17,000 printed volumes
and about 350 MSS., several of which were presented by its founder,
William of Wykeham. Oriel College Library, besides its other
possessions, has a special collection of books on comparative philology
and mythology, with a printed catalogue. The fine library of Queen&rsquo;s
College is strong in theology, in English and modern European
history, and in English county histories. St John&rsquo;s College Library
is largely composed of the literature of theology and jurisprudence
before 1750, and possesses a collection of medical books of the 16th
and 17th centuries. The newer half of the library building was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page554" id="page554"></a>554</span>
erected by Inigo Jones at the expense of Laud, who also gave many
printed and manuscript books. The room used as a library at
Trinity College formed part of Durham College, the library of which
was established by Richard of Bury. Wadham College Library
includes a collection of botanical books bequeathed by Richard
Warner in 1775 and a collection of books, relating chiefly to the
Spanish Reformers, presented by the executors of Benjamin Wiffen.
Worcester College Library has of late specially devoted itself to
classical archaeology. It is also rich in old plays.</p>

<p>The college libraries as a rule have not been used to the extent they
deserve, and a good deal must be done before they can be said to be
as useful and efficient as they might be.</p>
</div>

<p>The history of the University Library at Cambridge dates
from the earlier part of the 15th century. Two early lists of
its contents are preserved, the first embracing 52 vols.
dating from about 1425, the second a shelf-list, apparently
<span class="sidenote">Cambridge.</span>
of 330 vols., drawn up by the outgoing proctors
in 1473. Its first great benefactor was Thomas Scott of Rotherham,
archbishop of York, who erected in 1475 the building in
which the library continued until 1755. He also gave more than
200 books and manuscripts to the library, some of which still
remain. The library received other benefactions, but nevertheless
appeared &ldquo;but mean&rdquo; to John Evelyn when he visited
Cambridge in 1654. In 1666 Tobias Rustat presented a sum of
money to be invested to buy the choicest and most useful books.
In 1715 George I. presented the library of Bishop Moore, which
was very rich in early English printed books, forming over
30,000 vols. of printed books and manuscripts. The funds
bequeathed by William Worts and John Manistre, together with
that of Rustat, produce at present about £1500 a year. The
share of university dues appropriated to library purposes
amounts to £3000 a year. In addition the library is entitled to
new books under the Copyright Acts. The number of printed
volumes in the library cannot be exactly stated, as no recent
calculation on the subject exists. It has been estimated at half
a million. It includes a fine series of <i>editiones principes</i> of the
classics and of the early productions of the English press. The
MSS. number over 6000, in which are included a considerable
number of adversaria or printed books with MS. notes, which
form a leading feature in the collection. The most famous of
the MSS. is the celebrated copy of the four gospels and the Acts
of the Apostles, which is known as <i>Codex Bezae</i>, and which was
presented to the university by that Reformer.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>A catalogue of the MSS. has been published in 4 vols. (1856-1861),
and this has been followed up by the publication of a number of
separate catalogues of Persian, Syriac, Hebrew, Chinese, &amp;c., MSS.
There is no published catalogue of the books, although the catalogue
is in print, the accessions being printed and cut up and arranged in
volumes. A catalogue of English books before 1640 is in course of
publication. The regulations of the library with regard to the
lending of books are very liberal, as many as ten volumes being
allowed out to one borrower at the same time. The annual income
is about £7000.</p>
</div>

<p>There is a library attached to the Fitzwilliam Museum, bequeathed
to the university in 1816. It consists of the entire
library of Lord Fitzwilliam, with the addition of an archaeological
library bought from the executors of Colonel Leake, and a small
number of works, chiefly on the history of art, since added by
purchase or bequest. It contains a collection of engravings of
old masters, a collection of music, printed and MS., and a
collection of illuminated MSS., chiefly French and Flemish, of
the 14th to 16th centuries. The books are not allowed to be
taken out. Catalogues and reprints of some of the music and
other collections have been published.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The library of Trinity College, which is contained in a magnificent
hall built by Sir Christopher Wren, has about 90,000 printed and
1918 MS. vols., and is especially strong in theology, classics and
bibliography. It owes to numerous gifts and bequests the possession
of a great number of rare books and manuscripts. Amongst these
special collections are the Capell collection of early dramatic and
especially Shakespearian literature, the collection of German theology
and philosophy bequeathed by Archdeacon Hare, and the Grylls
bequest in 1863 of 9600 vols., including many early printed books.
There are printed catalogues of the Sanskrit and other Oriental
MSS. by Dr Aufrecht and Professor Palmer, and of the incunabula by
the late librarian, Mr Sinker. The library is open to all members
of the college, and the privilege of using it is liberally extended to
properly accredited students. One of the most interesting libraries
is that of Trinity Hall, in which the original bookcases and benches
are preserved, and many books are seen chained to the cases, as used
formerly to be the practice.</p>

<p>None of the other college libraries rivals Trinity in the number of
books. The library of Christ&rsquo;s College received its first books from
the foundress. Clare College Library includes a number of Italian
and Spanish plays of the end of the 16th century left by George
Ruggle. The library of Corpus Christi College first became notable
through the bequest of books and MSS. made by Archbishop Parker
in 1575. The printed books are less than 5000 in number, and the
additions now made are chiefly in such branches as throw light on
the extremely valuable collection of ancient MSS., which attracts
scholars from all parts of Europe. There is a printed catalogue of
these MSS. Gonville and Caius College Library is of early foundation.
A catalogue of the MSS. was printed in 1849, with pictorial illustrations,
and a list of the incunabula in 1850. The printed books of
King&rsquo;s College includes the fine collection bequeathed by Jacob
Bryant in 1804. The MSS. are almost wholly Oriental, chiefly
Persian and Arabic, and a catalogue of them has been printed.
Magdalene College possesses the curious library formed by Pepys
and bequeathed by him to the college, together with his collections
of prints and drawings and of rare British portraits. It is remarkable
for its treasures of popular literature and English ballads, as well as
for the Scottish manuscript poetry collected by Sir Richard Maitland.
The books are kept in Pepys&rsquo;s own cases, and remain just as he
arranged them himself. The library Of Peterhouse is the oldest
library in Cambridge, and possesses a catalogue of some 600 or 700
books dating from 1418, in which year it was completed. It is chiefly
theological, though it possesses a valuable collection of modern works
on geology and natural science, and a unique collection of MS. music.
Queen&rsquo;s College Library contains about 30,000 vols. mainly in
theology, classics and Semitic literature, and has a printed class-catalogue.
The library of St John&rsquo;s College is rich in early printed
books, and possesses a large collection of English historical tracts.
Of the MSS. and rare books there is a printed catalogue.</p>
</div>

<p>The library of the university of London, founded in 1837,
has over 60,000 vols, and includes the Goldsmith Library of
economic literature, numbering 30,000 vols. Other
collections are De Morgan&rsquo;s collection of mathematical
<span class="sidenote">London.</span>
books, Grote&rsquo;s classical library, &amp;c. There is a printed catalogue
of 1897, with supplements. Since its removal to South Kensington,
this library has been greatly improved and extended.
University College Library, Gower Street, established in 1829,
has close upon 120,000 vols. made up chiefly of separate collections
which have been acquired from time to time. Many of
these collections overlap, and much duplicating results, leading
to congestion. These collections include Jeremy Bentham&rsquo;s
library, Morrison&rsquo;s Chinese library, Barlow&rsquo;s Dante library,
collections of law, mathematical, Icelandic, theological, art,
oriental and other books, some of them of great value.</p>

<p>King&rsquo;s College Library, founded in 1828, has over 30,000 vols.
chiefly of a scientific character. In close association with the
university of London is the London School of Economics and
Political Science in Clare Market, in which is housed the British
Library of Political Science with 50,000 vols. and a large number
of official reports and pamphlets.</p>

<p>The collegiate library at Dulwich dates from 1619, and a
list of its earliest accessions, in the handwriting of the founder,
may still be seen. There are now about 17,000 vols. of miscellaneous
works of the 17th and 18th centuries, with a few
rare books. A catalogue of them was printed in 1880; and one
describing the MSS. (567) and the muniments (606) was issued
during the succeeding year. The last two classes are very important,
and include the well-known &ldquo;Alleyn Papers&rdquo; and the
theatrical diary of Philip Henslow. Sion College is a gild of the
parochial clergy of the city and suburbs of London, and the
library was founded in 1629 for their use; laymen may also
read (but not borrow) the books when recommended by some
beneficed metropolitan clergyman. The library is especially
rich in liturgies, Port-Royal authors, pamphlets, &amp;c., and contains
about 100,000 vols. classified on a modification of the Decimal
system. The copyright privilege was commuted in 1835 for an
annual sum of £363, 15s. 2d. The present building was opened
in 1886 and is one of the striking buildings of the Victoria
Embankment.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Most of the London collegiate or teaching institutions have
libraries attached to them, and it will only be necessary to mention a
few of the more important to get an idea of their variety: Baptist
College (1810), 13,000 vols.; Bedford College (for women), 17,000
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page555" id="page555"></a>555</span>
vols.; Birkbeck College (1823), 12,000 vols.; Congregational
Library (1832-1893), 14,000 vols.; the Royal College of Music, containing
the library of the defunct Sacred Harmonic Society; Royal
Naval College (Greenwich, 1873), 7000 vols.; St Bartholomew&rsquo;s
Hospital (1422), 15,000 vols.; St Paul&rsquo;s School (1509), 10,000 vols.;
the Working Men&rsquo;s College (1854), 5000 vols.; and all the Polytechnic
schools in the Metropolitan area.</p>
</div>

<p>The university library of Durham (1832) contains about 35,000
vols., and all the modern English universities&mdash;Birmingham,
Mason University College (1880), 27,000 vols.; Leeds,
Liverpool (1882), 56,000 vols.; Manchester, Victoria
<span class="sidenote">English provinces.</span>
University, which absorbed Owens College (1851),
115,000 vols.; Newcastle-upon-Tyne; Sheffield (1907), &amp;c.&mdash;have
collections of books. The libraries in connexion with
theological colleges and public schools throughout England are
often quite extensive, and reference may be made to Eton
College (1441), 25,000 vols.; Haileybury (1862), 12,000 vols.;
Harrow (Vaughan Library), 12,000 vols.; Mill Hill; Oscott
College, Erdington (1838), 36,000 vols.; Rugby (1878), 8000
vols.; Stonyhurst College (1794), <i>c.</i> 40,000 vols., &amp;c. The new
building for the university of Wales at Bangor has ample
accommodation for an adequate library, and the University
College at Aberystwith is also equipped with a library.</p>

<p>The origin of the University Library of Edinburgh is to be
found in a bequest of his books of theology and law made to
the town in 1580 by Clement Little, advocate. This
was two years before the foundation of the university,
<span class="sidenote">Scotland.</span>
and in 1584 the town council caused the collection to be removed
to the college, of which they were the patrons. As it was the
only library in the town, it continued to grow and received many
benefactions, so that in 1615 it became necessary to erect a
library building. Stimulated perhaps by the example of Bodley
at Oxford, Drummond of Hawthornden made a large donation
of books, of which he printed a catalogue in 1627, and circulated
an appeal for assistance from others. In 1678 the library
received a bequest of 2000 vols. from the Rev. James Nairne.
In 1709 the library became entitled to the copy privilege, which
has since been commuted for a payment of £575 per annum.
In 1831 the books were removed to the present library buildings,
for which a parliamentary grant had been obtained. The main
library hall (190 ft. in length) is one of the most splendid apartments
in Scotland. One of the rooms is set apart as a memorial
to General Reid, by whose benefaction the library has greatly
benefited. Amongst the more recent accessions have been the
Halliwell-Phillips Shakespeare collection, the Laing collection of
Scottish MSS., the Baillie collection of Oriental MSS. (some of
which are of great value), and the Hodgson collection of works
on political economy. The library now consists of about 210,000
vols. of printed books with over 2000 MSS. Recently it has been
found necessary to make considerable additions to the shelving.
The library of the university of Glasgow dates from the 15th
century, and numbers George Buchanan and many other
distinguished men amongst its early benefactors. A classified
subject-catalogue has been printed, and there is also a printed
dictionary catalogue. The annual accessions are about 1500,
and the commutation-grant £707. Connected with the university,
which is trustee for the public, is the library of the
Hunterian Museum, formed by the eminent anatomist Dr
William Hunter. It is a collection of great bibliographical
interest, as it is rich in MSS. and in fine specimens of early
printing, especially in Greek and Latin classics. There are about
200,000 vols. in the library.</p>

<p>The first mention of a library at St Andrews is as early as 1456.
The three colleges were provided with libraries of their own about the
time of their foundation&mdash;St Salvator&rsquo;s 1455, St Leonard&rsquo;s 1512, St
Mary&rsquo;s 1537. The University Library was established about 1610
by King James VI., and in the course of the 18th century the college
libraries were merged in it. The copyright privilege was commuted
in 1837. The collection numbers 120,000 vols. exclusive of pamphlets,
with about 200 MSS., chiefly of local interest. A library is supposed
to have existed at Aberdeen since the foundation of King&rsquo;s College
by Bishop Elphinstone in 1494. The present collection combines the
libraries of King&rsquo;s College and Marischal College, now incorporated in
the university. The latter had its origin in a collection of books
formed by the town authorities at the time of the Reformation, and
for some time kept in one of the churches. The library has benefited
by the Melvin bequest, chiefly of classical books, and those of Henderson
and Wilson, and contains some very valuable books. The general
library is located in Old Aberdeen in a room of imposing design,
while the medical and law books are in the New Town in Marischal
College. The library has a grant, in lieu of the copyright privilege,
of £320. The annual income of the library is £2500, and it contains
over 180,000 vols. The books are classified on a modification of the
decimal system, and there are printed author and MS. subject-catalogues.
By arrangement with the municipal library authority, books
are lent to non-students. All the technical schools, public schools,
and theological and other colleges in Scotland are well equipped with
libraries as the following list will show:&mdash;Aberdeen: Free Church
College, 17,000 vols. Edinburgh: Fettes College, <i>c.</i> 5000 vols.;
Heriot&rsquo;s Hospital (1762), <i>c.</i> 5000 vols.; New College (1843), 50,000
vols. Glasgow: Anderson&rsquo;s College (containing the valuable Euing
music library), 16,000 vols.; United Free Church Theological
College, 33,000 vols. Trinity College, Glenalmond, 5000 vols.</p>
</div>

<p>The establishment of the library of Trinity College, Dublin,
is contemporaneous with that of the Bodleian at Oxford, and it
is an interesting circumstance that, when Challoner
and Ussher (afterwards the archbishop) were in
<span class="sidenote">Ireland.</span>
London purchasing books to form the library, they met Bodley
there, and entered into friendly intercourse and co-operation with
him to procure the choicest and best books. The commission
was given to Ussher and Challoner as trustees of the singular
donation which laid the foundation of the library. In the year
1601 the English army determined to commemorate their victory
over the Spanish troops at Kinsale by some permanent monument.
Accordingly they subscribed the sum of £1800 to establish
a library in the university of Dublin. For Ussher&rsquo;s own collection,
consisting of 10,000 vols. and many valuable MSS., the college
was also indebted to military generosity. On his death in 1655
the officers and soldiers of the English army then in Ireland
purchased the whole collection for £22,000 with the design of
presenting it to the college. Cromwell, however, interfered,
alleging that he proposed to found a new college, where the
books might more conveniently be preserved. They were
deposited therefore in Dublin Castle, and the college only
obtained them after the Restoration. In 1674 Sir Jerome
Alexander left his law books with some valuable MSS. to the
college. In 1726 Dr Palliser, archbishop of Cashel, bequeathed
over 4000 vols. to the library; and ten years later Dr Gilbert
gave the library nearly 13,000 vols. which he had himself collected
and arranged. In 1745 the library received a valuable
collection of MSS. as a bequest from Dr Stearne. In 1802 the
collection formed by the pensionary Fagel, which had been
removed to England on the French invasion of Holland, was
acquired for £10,000. It consisted of over 20,000 vols. In
1805 Mr Quin bequeathed a choice collection of classical and
Italian books. There have been many other smaller donations,
in addition to which the library is continually increased by the
books received under the Copyright Act. The library now
contains 300,000 vols. and over 2000 MSS. There is no permanent
endowment, and purchases are made by grants from the
board. The whole collections are contained in one building,
erected in 1732, consisting of eight rooms. The great library
hall is a magnificent apartment over 200 ft. long. A new reading-room
was opened in 1848. A catalogue of the books acquired
before 1872 has been printed (1887). There is a printed catalogue
of the MSS. and Incunabula (1890). Graduates of Dublin,
Oxford, and Cambridge are admitted to read permanently, and
temporary admission is granted by the board to any fit person
who makes application.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The library of Queen&rsquo;s College, Belfast (1849), contains about
60,000 vols., while Queen&rsquo;s College, Cork (1849), has over 32,000 vols.
St Patrick&rsquo;s College, Maynooth (1795), has about 60,000, and other
collegiate libraries are well supplied with books.</p>
</div>

<p>With one or two exceptions, libraries are attached to the
cathedrals of England and Wales. Though they are of course
intended for the use of the cathedral or diocesan
clergy, they are in most cases open to any respectable
<span class="sidenote">Cathedral and church libraries.</span>
person who may be properly introduced. They seldom
contain very much modern literature, chiefly consisting
of older theology, with more or less addition of classical
and historical literature. They vary in extent from a few
volumes, as at Llandaff or St David&rsquo;s, to 20,000 vols., as at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page556" id="page556"></a>556</span>
Durham. Together they possess nearly 150,000 printed and
manuscript vols. As a rule, very little is spent upon them, and
they are very little used. The chamber in the old cloisters, in
which the library of the dean and chapter of Westminster is
preserved, is well known from the charming description by
Washington Irving in his <i>Sketch Book</i>. There are about 14,000
vols., mostly of old theology and history, including many rare
Bibles and other valuable books. The library of the dean and
chapter of St Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral was founded in very early times,
and now numbers some 22,000 vols. and pamphlets, mainly
theological, with a good collection of early Bibles and Testaments,
Paul&rsquo;s Cross Sermons, and works connected with the
cathedral.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best library of Catholic theology in London is
that of the Oratory at South Kensington, established in 1849,
and now containing nearly 35,000 vols. The Catholic Cathedral
of Westminster, of recent foundation, contains about 22,000 vols.
The archiepiscopal library at Lambeth was founded in 1610
by Archbishop Bancroft, and has been enriched by the gifts of
Laud, Tenison, Manners Sutton, and others of his successors;
it is now lodged in the noble hall built by Juxon. The treasures
consist of the illuminated MSS., and a rich store of early printed
books; of the latter two catalogues have been issued by Samuel
Roffey Maitland (1792-1866). The MSS. are described in H. J.
Todd&rsquo;s catalogue, 1812. The total number of printed books
and manuscripts is nearly 45,000.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The library of Christ Church, Oxford, belongs alike to the college
and the cathedral, but will be more properly described as a college
library. The cathedral library of Durham dates from monastic times,
and possesses many of the books which belonged to the monastery.
These were added to by Dean Sudbury, the second founder of the
library, and Bishop Cosin. The collection has been considerably
increased in more modern times, and now contains 15,000 vols. It is
especially rich in MSS., some of which are of great beauty and value;
a catalogue of them was printed in 1825. The library has good
topographical and entomological collections. The chapter spend
£370 per annum in salaries and in books. The library at York
numbers about 11,000 vols., and has been very liberally thrown open
to the public. It is kept in the former chapel of the archbishop&rsquo;s
palace, and has many valuable MSS. and early printed books. The
foundation of the library at Canterbury dates probably from the
Roman mission to England, <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 596, although the library does not
retain any of the books then brought over, or even of the books said
to have been sent by Pope Gregory to the first archbishop in 601.
It is recorded that among Lanfranc&rsquo;s buildings was a new library, and
Becket is said to have collected books abroad to present to the
library. The collection now numbers about 9900 printed books, with
about 110 MS. vols., and between 6000 and 7000 documents. A
catalogue was printed in 1802. The present building was erected in
1867 on part of the site of the monastic dormitory. The library at
Lincoln contains 7400 vols., of which a catalogue was printed in 1859.
It possesses a fine collection of political tracts of the age of Elizabeth,
James and Charles I. The present collection at Chichester dates
from the Restoration only; that at Ely is rich in books and tracts
relating to the non-jurors. The library at Exeter possesses many
Saxon MSS. of extreme interest, one of them being the gift of Leofric,
the first bishop. The treasures of Lichfield were destroyed by the
Puritans during the civil war, and the existing library is of later
formation. Frances, duchess of Somerset, bequeathed to it nearly
1000 vols., including the famous Evangeliary of St Chad. The
collection at Norwich is chiefly modern, and was presented by Dr
Sayers. The earlier library at Peterborough having almost wholly
perished in the civil war, Bishop White Kennett became the virtual
founder of the present collection. Salisbury is rich in incunabula,
and a catalogue has recently been printed. Winchester Cathedral
Library is mainly the bequest of Bishop Morley in the 17th century.
The library at Bristol, then numbering 6000 or 7000 vols., was burnt
and pillaged by the mob in the riots of 1831. Only about 1000
vols. were saved, many of which were recovered, but few additions
have been made to them. At Chester in 1691 Dean Arderne bequeathed
his books and part of his estate &ldquo;as the beginning of a
public library for the clergy and city.&rdquo; The library of Hereford is a
good specimen of an old monastic library; the books are placed in
the Lady Chapel, and about 230 choice MSS. are chained to oaken
desks. The books are ranged with the edges outwards upon open
shelves, to which they are attached by chains and bars. Another
most interesting &ldquo;chained&rdquo; library is that at Wimborne Minster,
Dorset, which contains about 280 books in their original condition.
The four Welsh cathedrals were supplied with libraries by a deed of
settlement in 1709. The largest of them, that of St Asaph, has about
1750 vols. The Bibliotheca Leightoniana, or Leightonian Library,
founded by Archbishop Leighton in 1684 in Dunblane Cathedral,
Scotland, contains about 2000 vols., and is the only cathedral library
in Scotland of any historic interest. The library of St Benedict&rsquo;s
Abbey, Fort Augustus (1878) with 20,000 vols. is an example of a
recent foundation. The public library in St Patrick&rsquo;s Cathedral,
Dublin, sometimes called Marsh&rsquo;s Library after its founder, was
established about 1694 by Archbishop Marsh, was incorporated by
act of parliament in 1707, and endowed by its founder at his death in
1713. The building was erected by the founder, and the original
oak fittings still remain. There is no room for additions, and a large
collection of modern books was refused a few years ago on that account.
The endowment is too small to allow of purchases from the
funds of the library, so that it still retains the character of a 17th-century
library. The books are chiefly theological, and in the
learned languages; they include the libraries of Bishop Stillingfleet
and of Elias Bouhereau, a French refugee, who was the first librarian.</p>
</div>

<p>Endowed libraries may be defined as those which have been
directly established by the bequests of individuals or corporate
bodies, excluding those which have been assisted by
donors or are merely named after them. As compared
<span class="sidenote">Endowed libraries.</span>
with the United States, the endowed libraries of
Britain are few in number, although several are of great importance.
London possesses very few libraries which have been
endowed by individual donors. The principal are the Bishopsgate
Institute (1891), which was founded out of sundry City of
London charities, and now contains about 44,000 vols., and is
celebrated for a fine collection of local prints, drawings and
maps. It is open free to persons in the east part of the City.
The Cripplegate Institute (1896) in Golden Lane, also founded
out of charity moneys, has three branches&mdash;St Bride&rsquo;s Foundation
Institute (18,000 vols.), jointly; Queen Street, Cheapside,
Branch (8000 vols.); and St Luke&rsquo;s Institute (5000 vols.)&mdash;and
contains 28,000 vols. Lectures and other entertainments are
features of both these libraries. Dr Williams&rsquo; library was
founded by the will of an eminent Presbyterian divine of that
name; it was opened in 1729. The books (50,000) are housed
in a new building in Gordon Square, completed in 1873. Theology
of all schools of opinion is represented, and there are special
collections of theosophical books and MSS., the works of Boehme,
Law, and other mystical writers. The MSS. include the original
minutes of the Westminster Assembly, letters and treatises of
Richard Baxter, &amp;c. The St Bride Foundation Technical
Reference Library (1895) is a very complete collection of books
and specimens of printing and the allied arts, including the
libraries of William Blades and Talbot Baines Reed, and a
number of more modern books presented by Mr Passmore
Edwards. It contains about 18,000 vols., and is open to all
persons interested in printing, lithography, &amp;c., and also to the
general public.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The most notable of the English provincial endowed libraries are
those established in Manchester. The fine old library established by
Humphrey Chetham in 1653 is still housed in the old collegiate
buildings where Sir Walter Raleigh was once entertained by Dr Dee.
The collection consists largely of older literature, and numbers about
60,000 volumes and MSS. It is freely open to the public, and may
be said to have been the first free library in England. Catalogues
in broad classified form were issued in 1791-1863, and there have
been supplements since. A remarkable instance of a great library
established by private munificence is that of the John Rylands
Library at Manchester, which was founded, erected and endowed by
Mrs E. A. Rylands in memory of her husband, and is contained in a
magnificent building designed by Basil Champneys and opened in
1899. The collection was formed largely on the famous Althorp
Library, made by Earl Spencer (40,000 vols.), one of the most remarkable
collections of early printed books and rare Bibles ever
brought together. The present number of volumes is about 115,000,
of which over 2500 are incunabula. A short-title catalogue, 3 vols.
4to., and one of English books, have been published, and a manuscript
dictionary catalogue has been provided. Several valuable
special catalogues and descriptive lists have been issued, one of the
latest being a special catalogue of the architectural works contained
in all the Manchester libraries.</p>

<p>The William Salt Library, a special Staffordshire library with
numerous MSS. and other collections, formed to bring together
materials for a history of Staffordshire, was opened to the public in
1874 in the town of Stafford. It contains nearly 20,000 books, prints
and other items.</p>

<p>Other endowed libraries in the English provinces which deserve
mention are the Bingham Public Library (1905) at Cirencester;
the Guille-Allès Library (1856), Guernsey; St Deiniol&rsquo;s Library
(1894), Hawarden, founded by William Ewart Gladstone, the great
statesman; and the Shakespeare Memorial Library and theatre
(1879) at Stratford-upon-Avon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page557" id="page557"></a>557</span></p>

<p>The most important endowed library in Scotland is the Mitchell
Library in Glasgow, founded by Stephen Mitchell, tobacco-manufacturer
(1874), who left £70,000 for the purpose. It was opened in
1877 in temporary premises, and after various changes will soon be
transferred to a very fine new building specially erected. It contains
some very valuable special collections, among which may be
mentioned Scottish poetry, Burns&rsquo; works, Glasgow books and printing,
and a choice collection of fine books on art and other subjects
given by Robert Jeffrey. It contains nearly 200,000 vols. and is the
reference library for the Glasgow public library system. Another
older Glasgow public library, also founded by a tobacco merchant,
is Stirling&rsquo;s and Glasgow Public Library (1791), which was endowed
by Walter Stirling, and amalgamated with an existing subscription
library. It contains 60,000 vols. and is free to reference readers,
but a subscription is charged for borrowing privileges. Still another
Glasgow institution is Baillie&rsquo;s Institution Free Reference Library,
established under the bequest of George Baillie (1863), but not
opened till 1887. It contains over 24,000 vols. Other Scottish
endowed libraries are the Anderson Library, Woodside, Aberdeen
(1883); the Taylor Free Library, Crieff (1890); the Elder Free
Library, Govan (1900); and the Chambers Institution, Peebles
(1859), founded by William Chambers, the well-known publisher.
The public library of Armagh, Ireland, was founded by Lord Primate
Robinson in 1770, who gave a considerable number of books and an
endowment. The books are freely available, either on the spot, or
by loan on deposit of double the value of the work applied for.</p>
</div>

<p>There are many libraries belonging to societies
devoted to the study of every kind of subject, and
<span class="sidenote">Libraries of societies and learned bodies.</span>
it is only necessary to mention a few of the principal.
Full particulars of most of them will be found in
Reginald A. Rye&rsquo;s <i>Libraries of London: a Guide for
Students</i> (1910), a work of accuracy and value.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Of the law libraries, that at Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn, London, is the oldest
and the largest. It dates from 1497, when John Nethersale, a member
of the society, made a bequest of forty marks, part of which was to
be devoted to the building of a library for the benefit of the students
of the laws of England. A catalogue of the printed books was
published in 1859 and since supplemented, and the MSS. were catalogued
by the Rev. Joseph Hunter in 1837. There are about 72,000
vols. The library of the Inner Temple is known to have existed in
1540. In the middle of the 17th century it received a considerable
benefaction from William Petyt, the well-known keeper of the Tower
records. There are now about 60,000 vols., including the pamphlets
collected by John Adolphus for his <i>History of England</i>, books on
crime and prisons brought together by Mr Crawford, and a selection
of works on jurisprudence made by John Austin. A library in connexion
with the Middle Temple was in existence during the reign of
Henry VIII., but the date usually assigned to its foundation is 1641,
when Robert Ashley left his books to the inn of which he had been
a member. There are now about 50,000 vols. Gray&rsquo;s Inn Library
(21,000 vols.) was perhaps established before 1555. In 1669 was
made the first catalogue of the books, and the next, still extant, in
1689. The Law Society (1828) has a good law and general library
(50,000 vols.), including the best collection of private acts of parliament
in England. The library of the Royal Society (1667), now
housed in Burlington House, contains over 80,000 vols., of which
many are the transactions and other publications of scientific bodies.
The Royal Institution of Great Britain (1803) possesses a reference
library of 60,000 vols. Some of its early catalogues were in classified
form. The London Institution (1805), in the City, is a general
library of reference and lending books open to members only. There
are about 150,000 vols., and lectures are given in connexion with the
institution. The Royal Society of Arts has a library numbering
about 11,000 vols., chiefly the publications of other learned bodies.</p>

<p>The best library of archaeology and kindred subjects is that of the
Society of Antiquaries, Burlington House, consisting of nearly
40,000 printed vols. and many MSS. It is rich in early printed books,
topography, heraldry and numismatics, and includes a curious
collection of books on pageants presented by Mr Fairholt, and the
remarkable assemblage of lexicographical works formerly belonging
to Albert Way.</p>

<p>Of libraries devoted to the natural sciences may be mentioned
those of the Geological Society of London (1807), with over 30,000
vols. and maps; the Linnean Society (1788), 35,000 vols.; the
Zoological Society (1829), about 31,000 vols. Of libraries associated
with medicine there are those of the Royal Society of Medicine (1907),
incorporating a number of medical societies, over 95,000 vols., about
to be housed in a new building; the Royal College of Physicians
(1525), 26,000 vols.; the British Medical Association, 20,000 vols.;
the Royal College of Surgeons of England (1800), 60,000 vols., with a
MS. catalogue on cards; the Chemical Society (1841), over 25,000
vols.; and the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain (1841),
about 15,000 vols. Other important London society libraries are&mdash;the
Royal Geographical Society (1830), 50,000 vols., and numerous
maps in a special room, open to the public for reference; the Royal
Colonial Institute (1868), 70,000 vols. of British colonial literature;
the Royal United Service Institution, Whitehall (1831), has 32,000
works on military and naval subjects and a museum. Large and
interesting collections of books are owned by the British and Foreign
Bible Society, the Institution of Civil Engineers, the Institution of
Electrical Engineers (containing the Ronalds Library), the Royal
Academy, the Royal Institute of British Architects, and practically
every other working society in London.</p>

<p>The English provincial libraries connected with societies or learned
bodies are mostly attached to those concerned with law, medicine,
and various antiquarian, literary and scientific subjects. The headquarters
of most national societies being in London to some extent
accounts for the comparatively small number of these special
libraries in the provinces.</p>

<p>The most important libraries of this description outside London
are situated in Scotland and Ireland, and one at least is practically
a national collection.</p>

<p>The principal library in Scotland is that of the Faculty of Advocates
at Edinburgh, who in 1680 appointed a committee of their
number, which reported that &ldquo;it was fitt that, seeing if the recusants
could be made pay their entire money, there wold be betwixt three
thousand and four thousand pounds in cash; that the same be imployed
on the best and fynest lawers and other law bookes, conforme
to a catalogue to be condescended upon by the Facultie, that the
samen may be a fonde for ane Bibliothecque whereto many lawers
and others may leave their books.&rdquo; In 1682 the active carrying out
of the scheme was committed to the Dean of Faculty, Sir George
Mackenzie of Rosehaugh, who may be regarded as the founder of the
library. In 1684 the first librarian was appointed, and the library
appears to have made rapid progress, since it appears from the
treasurer&rsquo;s accounts that in 1686 the books and furniture were
valued at upwards of £11,000 Scots, exclusive of donations. In the
year 1700, the rooms in the Exchange Stairs, Parliament Close, in
which the library was kept, being nearly destroyed by fire the
collection was removed to the ground floor of the Parliament House,
where it has ever since remained. The library retains the copyright
privilege conferred upon it in 1709. Of the special collections the
most important are the Astorga collection of old Spanish books,
purchased by the faculty in 1824 for £4000; the Thorkelin collection,
consisting of about 1200 vols., relating chiefly to the history and
antiquities of the northern nations, and including some rare books on
old Scottish poetry; the Dietrich collection of over 100,000 German
pamphlets and dissertations, including many of the writings of
Luther and Melanchthon, purchased for the small sum of £80; and
the Combe collection.</p>

<p>The faculty appear early to have turned their attention to the
collection of MSS., and this department of the library now numbers
about 3000 vols. Many of them are of great interest and value,
especially for the civil and ecclesiastical history of Scotland before and
after the Reformation. There are thirteen monastic chartularies
which escaped the destruction of the religious houses to which they
belonged. The MSS. relating to Scottish church history include the
collections of Spottiswoode, Wodrow and Calderwood. The
Wodrow collection consists of 154 vols., and includes his correspondence,
extending from 1694 to 1726. Sir James Balfour&rsquo;s collection
and the Balcarres papers consist largely of original state papers, and
include many interesting royal letters of the times of James V.,
Queen Mary and James VI. The Sibbald papers, numbering over
30 vols., are largely topographical. The Riddel notebooks, numbering
156 vols., contain collections to illustrate the genealogy of
Scottish families. There are about one hundred volumes of Icelandic
MSS., purchased in 1825 from Professor Finn Magnusson, and some
Persian and Sanskrit, with a few classical, manuscripts. The department
has some interesting treasures of old poetry, extending to
73 vols. The most important are the Bannatyne MS., in 2 vols. folio,
written by George Bannatyne in 1568, and the Auchinleck MS., a
collection of ancient English poetry, named after Alexander Boswell
of Auchinleck, who presented it in 1774.</p>

<p>The first catalogue of the printed books was compiled in 1692, and
contains a preface by Sir George Mackenzie. Another was prepared
under the care of Ruddiman in 1742. In 1853 the late Mr Halkett
commenced a catalogue, which has been printed in 6 vols. 4to, with
a supplement, and includes all the printed books in the library at
the end of 1871, containing about 260,000 entries. The library,
managed by a keeper and staff, under a board of six curators, is
easily accessible to all persons engaged in literary work, and now
contains about 500,000 vols.</p>

<p>The library of the Writers to the Signet was established by the
Society at Edinburgh in 1755. At first it consisted of law books
exclusively, but in 1788 they began to collect the best editions of works
in other departments of literature. During the librarianship of
Macvey Napier (1805-1837) the number of volumes was more than
sextupled, and in 1812 the library was removed to the new hall
adjoining the Parliament House. In 1834 the upper hall was devoted
to the collection. This is a magnificent apartment 142 ft.
long, with a beautiful cupola painted by Stothard. The library now
contains over 110,000 vols. and includes some fine specimens of early
printing, as well as many other rare and costly works. It is especially
rich in county histories and British topography and antiquities. A
catalogue of the law books was printed in 1856. The late David
Laing, who became librarian in 1837, published the first volume of a
new catalogue in 1871, and in 1891 this was completed with a subject
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page558" id="page558"></a>558</span>
index. The books are lent out to the writers and even to strangers
recommended by them.</p>

<p>The library of the Royal Irish Academy at Dublin was established
on the formation of the Academy in 1785 for the purpose of promoting
the study of science, literature and antiquities in Ireland. The
library possesses about 80,000 printed vols. and MSS. There is a
large collection of MSS. and books relating to the history, ancient
language, and antiquities of Ireland. They include the Betham
collection, acquired partly by public subscription in 1851. The
library is partly supported by a government grant and is freely open
on a proper introduction. The publication of Irish MSS. in the
library was begun in 1870, and has since continued; the general
catalogue is in manuscript form.</p>

<p>The library of King&rsquo;s Inns was founded, pursuant to a bequest of
books and legal MSS. under the will of Mr Justice Robinson in 1787,
to form the nucleus of a library for law students. It is partly supported
from the funds of the benchers, but partly also by a treasury
grant in lieu of the copyright privilege.</p>

<p>It is needless to describe the other society libraries, as most of them
are described in annuals like the <i>Literary Year-book</i> and similar
publications, with statistics of stock, issues, &amp;c., brought up to date.</p>
</div>

<p>Proprietary and subscription libraries were at one time more
common than now, as, owing to the steady advance of the
municipal library, the minor subscription libraries
have been gradually extinguished. A striking example
<span class="sidenote">Proprietary and subscription libraries.</span>
of this is furnished by the mechanics&rsquo; institutes which
used to flourish all over the country. In most cases
these have been handed over to the local authorities
by the owners to form the nucleus of the public rate-supported
library, and in this way the older libraries have been preserved
and valuable aid has been given to the popular library movement.
Somewhat akin to the mechanics&rsquo; institutes are the
libraries established in connexion with various co-operative
societies in the north of England. Together with working men&rsquo;s
club libraries, there must be nearly 100 libraries of the class just
mentioned, ranging in size from a few hundred vols. to 30,000 or
40,000 vols. The affiliated clubs of the Working Men&rsquo;s Club and
Institute Union possess among them over 100,000 vols.</p>

<p>Among subscription libraries, the London Library stands
first in order of importance. It was founded in 1841 as a lending
library for the use of scholars, and Dean Milman, Sir G. C. Lewis,
W. E. Gladstone, Thomas Carlyle, Henry Hallam and other
eminent men took part in its formation. By means of a moderate
subscription, funds were raised for the purchase of books on
general subjects, which now amount to about 250,000 vols.
Of these elaborate and excellent author and subject catalogues
have been printed. The last is valuable as a classified guide to
the contents of the library.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Some mention should be made also of the more important subscription
or proprietary libraries, which were formed for the most part in
the latter half of the 18th century. The earliest circulating library in
the metropolis was established about the middle of the 18th century.
The first in Birmingham was opened by Hutton in 1757. The idea
of a proprietary library appears to have been first carried out at
Liverpool in 1758. The library then formed still flourishes at the
Lyceum, and possesses a collection of 55,000 vols. and an income of
£1000 a year. In 1760 a library was formed at Warrington which
has been merged in the Warrington Museum. The Leeds library
was established in 1768, and now has 64,000 vols. In 1772 the Bristol
museum and library was formed, and numbered Coleridge, Southey
and Landor among its earlier members. It has now been merged in
the reference collection of the Bristol public libraries. The Birmingham
(old) library was formed in 1779, and its rules were drawn up
by Dr Priestley. The library has now about 80,000 vols.</p>

<p>Other English proprietary libraries have been established at
Leicester, Liverpool (Athenaeum, 1798), Manchester, Nottingham
and elsewhere. In Scotland the first subscription library was started
by Allan Ramsay, the poet, at Edinburgh in 1725, and since that time
commercial subscription libraries have increased greatly in number
and size, Mudie&rsquo;s and <i>The Times</i> Book Club being typical modern
examples.</p>
</div>

<p>Many of the principal clubs possess libraries; that of the
Athenaeum (London) is by far the most important. It now
numbers about 75,000 vols. of books in all departments
of literature, and is especially rich in well-bound and
<span class="sidenote">Club libraries.</span>
fine copies of works on the fine arts, archaeology,
topography and history. The pamphlets, of which there is a
complete printed catalogue, as well as of the books, form a
remarkable series, including those collected by Gibbon and
Mackintosh. Next comes the Reform Club, with about 60,000
vols., chiefly in belles-lettres, with a fair proportion of parliamentary
and historical works. The National Liberal Club,
containing the Gladstone Library, has about 45,000 vols., and
may be used occasionally by non-members. The Oxford and
Cambridge Club has 30,000 vols. in general and classical literature.
At the Garrick there is a small dramatic collection; and the
(Senior) United Service Club, besides a number of books on
professional subjects, possesses the fine library which formerly
belonged to Dugald Stewart.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Other London clubs which possess libraries are the Carlton with
25,000 vols.; the Constitutional with 12,000 vols.; Grand Lodge of
Freemasons, 10,000 vols.; Alpine, 5000 vols.; Travellers, 8000
vols.; and Junior Carlton, 6000 vols. In the provinces and in
Scotland and Ireland every club of a social character has a reading-room,
and in most cases a library is attached.</p>
</div>

<p>The first act of parliament authorizing the establishment of
public libraries in England was obtained by William Ewart,
M.P. for the Dumfries Burghs, in 1850. This arose out
of the report of a special parliamentary committee
<span class="sidenote">Municipal libraries.</span>
appointed to enquire into the management of the
British Museum in 1835, and a more general report on
libraries in 1849, at which much evidence was submitted to
prove the necessity for providing public libraries. Ewart
obtained both committees and also, in 1845, procured an act
for &ldquo;encouraging the establishment of museums in large towns.&rdquo;
Neither the 1845 nor 1850 acts proved effective, owing chiefly
to the limitation of the library rate to ½d. in the £ of rental,
which produced in most cases an insufficient revenue. In 1853
the Library Act of 1850 was extended to Ireland and Scotland,
and in 1854 Scotland obtained an act increasing the rate limit
from ½d. to 1d. in the £. In 1855 Ireland also obtained a penny
rate, and later in the same year England obtained the same
power by an act which remained the principal library act, with
some intermediate amendments, till 1892, when a Public Library
Consolidation Act was passed. In the following year, 1893, the
power of adopting the acts, or putting them in operation, was
transferred from the ratepayers to the local authority, save in
the case of rural parishes and the metropolitan vestries. By
the London Government Act of 1899, however, the metropolitan
boroughs were given the power of adopting the acts of 1892-1893
without consulting the ratepayers, so that as the law at present
stands, any urban district can put the public libraries acts in
force without reference to the voters. Rural parishes are still
required by the provisions of the Local Government Act 1894
to adopt the 1892 Libraries Act by means of a parish meeting,
or if a poll is demanded, by means of a poll of the voters.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The main points in British library legislation are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The acts are permissive in character and not compulsory, and
can only be put in force by a vote of a majority of members in an
urban district or city, or of a majority of voters in rural districts.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The amount of rate which can be collected is limited to one
penny in the pound of the rateable value of the district, though in
some towns power has been obtained by special legislation for
local purposes to increase the amount to 2d. In a few cases, as at
Birmingham, no limit is fixed. The incomes produced by the penny
in the pound range from less than £10 in a rural district to over
£25,000 in a large city.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Municipal libraries are managed by committees appointed
by the local authorities, who may, if so disposed, delegate to them all
their powers and duties under section 15 of the act of 1892. The
local authorities in England have also power to appoint persons on
such committees who are not members of the council. By the Scottish
principal act of 1887 committees are to consist of one-half councillors
and one-half non-councillors, not to exceed a total of 20, and these
committees become independent bodies not subject to the councils.
Glasgow has contracted out of this arrangement by means of a
special act. In Ireland, committees are appointed much on the same
system as in England.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Power is given to provide libraries, museums, schools for
science, art galleries, and schools for art. Needless to say it is impossible
to carry on so many departments with the strictly limited
means provided by the acts, although some towns have attempted
to do so. The Museums and Gymnasiums Act of 1891 enables an
additional rate of ½d. to be raised for either purpose, and many places
which have established museums or art galleries under the provisions
of the Libraries Acts have also adopted the Museums Act in
order to increase their revenues.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) The regulation and management of public libraries are entrusted
to the library authority, which may either be the local
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page559" id="page559"></a>559</span>
authority, or a committee with a full or partial delegation of powers.
The library authority can buy books, periodicals, specimens of art
and science, and make all necessary rules for the proper working of
the libraries. A staff can be appointed, and arrangements may be
made with adjoining local authorities for the joint use of one or more
libraries. Buildings may also be erected, and money borrowed for
the purpose on the security of the local rates. These are the main
provisions of the library legislation of the United Kingdom as at
present existing. Revision and amendment are wanted as regards
the abolition or raising of the rate limitation, and some clearer
definitions as to powers which can be exercised, as, for example, the
right to spend money on lectures. The rate limitation is the most
serious obstacle to progress, and it affects the smaller towns to a
much greater degree than large cities or areas.</p>
</div>

<p>Between 1850 and 1910 about 630 local government areas of
all kinds adopted the Public Libraries Acts. Of these a considerable
number had in 1910 not yet put the acts in operation, whilst
the London Government Act 1899, by joining various previously
independent vestries or boards, extinguished about 23 library
areas. The Metropolitan County of London in 1910 comprised
25 library areas, or counting also the City, 26, and only Marylebone,
Bethnal Green and parts of Finsbury and Paddington
remained unprovided. Practically every large city or district
council has adopted the Public Libraries Acts or obtained special
legislation, and the only important places, in addition to Marylebone
and Bethnal Green, unprovided in 1910 were Bacup,
Crewe, Dover, Jarrow, Scarborough, Swindon, Weymouth,
Llandudno, Govan, Leith, Pollokshaws and Wishaw. In all,
556 places had library systems in operation, and among them
they possessed about 925 buildings.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The progress of the public library movement was very slow up to
1887, the year of Queen Victoria&rsquo;s jubilee. From 1887, however,
when many districts established libraries as memorials to Queen
Victoria, the progress has been much more rapid. An immense
stimulus to the movement was given from about 1900, when Mr
Andrew Carnegie (<i>q.v.</i>) began to present library buildings to towns
in England as well as to Scotland and the United States. The result
of this action was to increase the number of municipal libraries from
146 in 1886 to 556 in 1910; and in the 10 years up to 1910 during
which Mr Carnegie&rsquo;s gifts had been offered, no fewer than 163 places
had put the acts in operation, a yearly average of over 16 adoptions.</p>
</div>

<p>There is one municipal library whose importance demands
special mention, although it is not rate-supported under the
provisions of the Public Libraries Acts. This is the Guildhall
library of the Corporation of the City of London, which is a free
public reference library with a periodicals reading-room, and a
lending department for officials and members of the corporation.
A library was established for London by Sir Richard Whittington
between 1421-1426, and several notices in the civic records show
how well in those times the citizens cared for their books. But
it did not remain without accident; in 1522 the Lord Protector
Somerset carried off three cart-loads of books, and during the
great fire of 1666 the remainder was destroyed together with the
library buildings. Nothing was done to repair the loss until
1824, when a committee was appointed, and rooms set apart for
library purposes. In 1840 a catalogue of 10,000 vols. was
printed, and in 1859 a second was prepared of 40,000 vols.
In consequence of the large and increasing number of the readers,
the present fine building was commenced about ten years later,
and, after having cost £90,000, was opened in 1873 as a free
public library.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>There are now upwards of 136,000 printed vols. and 5900 MSS. in
the Guildhall library. The contents are of a general character, and
include a special collection of books about London, the Solomons
Hebrew and rabbinical library, and the libraries of the Clockmakers
Company and the old Dutch church in Austin Friars. Recently the
fine collection of books by and about Charles Dickens, called the
National Dickens Library, was added, and other special libraries of
a valuable nature, as well as an extensive and well-cared-for collection
of London prints, and drawings.</p>
</div>

<p>There is such a variety of library buildings in the
United Kingdom that it is not possible to single out
<span class="sidenote">British library administration.</span>
examples for special description, but a brief statement
of their work and methods will help to give some idea
of the extent of their activities.</p>

<p>The total number of borrowers enrolled in 1910 was<a name="fa11j" id="fa11j" href="#ft11j"><span class="sp">11</span></a> about
2,200,000, 59% males and 41% females, 48% under 20 years
of age and 52% over 20. Industrial and commercial occupations
were followed by 49% of the borrowers, the balance of 51%
being domestic, professional, unstated, and including 20% of
students and scholars. To these borrowers 60,000,000 vols.
are circulated every year for home-reading, and of this large
number 54% represented fiction, including juvenile literature.
The Reference libraries issued over 11,000,000 vols., exclusive
of books consulted at open shelves, and to the Reading-rooms,
Magazines, Newspapers, Directories, Time-tables, &amp;c., allowing
only one consultation for each visit, 85,000,000 visits are made
per annum. Allowing 5% for the reading of fiction in current
magazines, it appears that the percentage of fiction read in
British municipal libraries, taking into account the work of
every issuing or consulting department, is only about 24%.
This fact should be carefully recorded, as in the past municipal
libraries have suffered in the esteem of all sections of the public,
by being erroneously described as mere centres for the distribution
of common novels. The quality of the fiction selected is
the best obtainable, and, as shown above, it is not read to an
unreasonable or unnecessary extent.</p>

<p>The changes in character, policy and methods which have
marked library administration in the United Kingdom, have
affected libraries of all kinds, but on the whole the municipal
libraries have been most active in the promotion of improvements.
It is evident, moreover, even to the most casual observer,
that a complete revolution in library practice has been effected
since 1882, not only in the details of administration, but in the
initiation of ideas and experiments. One of the most notable
changes has been the gradual disappearance of the unclassified
library. Previous to 1882 very little had been accomplished in
the way of scientific classification schemes equipped with suitable
notations, although the Decimal method of Mr Melvil Dewey
had been applied in the United States. After that date this
system began to be adopted for reference departments in British
municipal libraries, till in 1910 at least 120 places had been
classified by means of the scheme. An English scheme, called
the &ldquo;Adjustable,&rdquo; with a notation, but not fully expanded, has
been adopted in 53 places, and a very complete and minute
scheme called the &ldquo;Subject,&rdquo; also English, has been used in
nearly 40 libraries, although it only dates from 1906. That
much remains to be accomplished in this direction is indicated
by the fact that over 340 municipal libraries were in 1910 not
closely classified, but only arranged in broad numerical or
alphabetical divisions. The adoption of exact schemes of
classification for books in libraries may be said to double their
utility almost mechanically, and in course of time an unclassified
municipal library will be unknown. The other kinds of library&mdash;state,
subscription, university, &amp;c.&mdash;are very often not classified,
but some use the Decimal system, while others, like the Patent
Office, have systems peculiar to themselves.</p>

<p>The catalogue, as a means of making known the contents of
books, has also undergone a succession of changes, both in
policy and mechanical construction. At one period, before
access to the shelves and other methods of making known the
contents of libraries had become general, the printed catalogue
was relied upon as practically the sole guide to the books. Many
excellent examples of such catalogues exist, in author, subject
and classified form, and some of them are admirable contributions
to bibliography. Within recent years, however, doubts have
arisen in many quarters, both in Europe and America, as to the
wisdom of printing the catalogues of general popular libraries
which possess comparatively few rare or extraordinary books.
A complete catalogue of such a library is out of date the moment
it is printed, and in many cases the cost is very great, while
only a small number is sold. For these and other reasons,
modern libraries have begun to compile complete catalogues
only in MS. form, and to issue comparatively cheap class-lists
at intervals, supplemented by monthly or quarterly bulletins
or lists of recent accessions, which in combination will answer
most of the questions likely to be put to a catalogue. Various
improvements in the mechanical construction of manuscript
catalogues have contributed to popularize them, and many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page560" id="page560"></a>560</span>
libraries use the card, sheaf and other systems which allow
constant and infinite intercalation coupled with economy and
ease in making additions.</p>

<p>The idea of using separate slips or cards for cataloguing books,
in order to obtain complete powers of arrangement and revision
is not new, having been applied during the French revolutionary
period to the cataloguing of libraries. More recently the system
has been applied to various commercial purposes, such as book-keeping
by what is known as the &ldquo;loose-leaf ledger,&rdquo; and in this
way greater public attention has been directed to the possibilities
of adjustable methods both in libraries and for business. The
card system is perhaps the most generally used at present, but
many improvements in the adjustable binders, called by
librarians the &ldquo;sheaf system,&rdquo; will probably result in this latter
form becoming a serious rival. The card method consists of a
series of cards in alphabetical or other order kept on edge in trays
or drawers, to which projecting guides are added in order to
facilitate reference. Entries are usually made on one side of the
card, and one card serves for a single entry. The sheaf method
provides for slips of an uniform size being kept in book form in
volumes capable of being opened by means of a screw or other
fastening, for the purpose of adding or withdrawing slips. In
addition to the advantage of being in book-form the sheaf system
allows both sides of a slip to be used, while in many cases from
two to twelve entries may be made on one slip. This is a great
economy and leads to considerable saving of space. A great
advantage resulting from the use of an adjustable manuscript
catalogue, in whatever form adopted, is the simplicity with
which it can be kept up-to-date. This is an advantage which in
the view of many librarians outweighs the undoubted valuable
qualities of comparative safety and multiplication of copies
possessed by the printed form. There are many different forms
of both card and sheaf systems, and practically every library
now uses one or other of them for cataloguing or indexing
purposes.</p>

<p>One other modification in connexion with the complete
printed catalogue has been tried with success, and seems worthy
of brief mention. After a complete manuscript catalogue has
been provided in sheaf form, a select or eclectic catalogue is
printed, comprising all the most important books in the library
and those that represent special subjects. This, when supplemented
by a printed list or bulletin of additions, seems to supply
every need.</p>

<p>The most striking tendency of the modern library movement
is the great increase in the freedom allowed to readers both in
reference and lending departments. Although access to the
shelves was quite a common feature in the older subscription
libraries, and in state libraries like the British Museum and
Patent Office, it is only within comparatively recent years that
lending library borrowers were granted a similar privilege.
Most municipal reference libraries grant access to a large or
small collection of books, and at Cambridge, Birmingham and
elsewhere in the United Kingdom, the practice is of long standing.
So also in the United States, practically every library has its
open shelf collection. On the continent of Europe, however,
this method is not at all general, and books are guarded with a
jealousy which in many cases must militate against their utility.
The first &ldquo;safe-guarded&rdquo; open access municipal lending library
was opened at Clerkenwell (now Finsbury), London, in 1893, and
since then over one hundred cities and districts of all sizes in
Britain have adopted the system. The British municipal
libraries differ considerably from those of the United States in
the safeguards against abuse which are employed, and the
result is that their losses are insignificant, whilst in America
they are sometimes enormous. Pawtucket and Cleveland in
America were pioneers to some extent of the open shelf system
for lending libraries, but the methods employed had little
resemblance to the safe-guarded system of British libraries.
The main features of the British plan are: exact classification;
class, shelf and book guiding; the provision of automatic
locking wickets to regulate the entrance and exit of borrowers,
and the rule that borrowers must be registered before they can
obtain admission. This last rule is not always current in
America, and in consequence abuses are liable to take place.
The great majority of British and American libraries, whether
allowing open access or not, use cards for charging or registering
books loaned to borrowers. In the United Kingdom a considerable
number of places still use indicators for this purpose,
although this mechanical method is gradually being restricted
to fiction, save in very small places.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Other activities of modern libraries which are common to both
Britain and America are courses of lectures, book exhibitions, work
with children, provision of books for the blind and for foreign
residents, travelling libraries and the education of library assistants.
In many of the recent buildings, especially in those erected from the
gifts of Mr Andrew Carnegie, special rooms for lectures and exhibitions
and children are provided. Courses of lectures in connexion
with the Liverpool and Manchester public libraries date from 1860,
but during the years 1900-1910 there was a very great extension
of this work. As a rule these courses are intended to direct attention
to the literature of the subjects treated, as represented in the
libraries, and in this way a certain amount of mutual advantage is
secured. In some districts the libraries work in association with the
education authorities, and thus it is rendered possible to keep schools
supplied with books, over which the teachers are able to exercise
supervision. This connexion between libraries and schools is much
less common in the United Kingdom than in the British colonies and
the United States, where the libraries are regarded as part of the
national system of education. Excellent work has been accomplished
within recent years by the Library Association in the training
of librarians, and it is usual for about 300 candidates to come forward
annually for examination in literary history, bibliography, classification,
cataloguing, library history and library routine for which
subjects certificates and diplomas are awarded. The profession of
municipal librarian is not by any means remunerative as compared
with employment in teaching or in the Civil Service, and until the
library rate is increased there is little hope of improvement.</p>

<p>The usefulness of public libraries has been greatly increased by the
work of the Library Association, founded in 1877, during the first
International Library Conference held in London in October 1877.
A charter of incorporation was granted to the association in 1898.
It holds monthly and annual meetings, publishes a journal, conducts
examinations, issues certificates, holds classes for instruction, and
has greatly helped to improve the public library law. The Library
Assistants Association (1895) publishes a journal. A second International
Library Conference was held at London in 1897, and a third
at Brussels in 1910. Library associations have been started in most
of the countries of Europe, and the American Library Association, the
largest and most important in existence, was established in 1876.
These associations are giving substantial aid in the development and
improvement of library methods and the status of librarians, and it
is certain that their influence will in time produce a more scientific
and valuable type of library than at present generally exists.</p>
</div>

<p class="pt1 center"><i>British Colonies and India.</i></p>

<p>The majority of the British Colonies and Dependencies have
permissive library laws on lines very similar to those in force
in the mother country. There are, however, several points
of difference which are worth mention. The rate limit is not
so strict in every case, and an effort is made to bring the libraries
into closer relations with the educational machinery of each
colony. There is, for example, no rate limit in Tasmania; and
South Australia may raise a library rate equivalent to 3d. in the
£, although, in both cases, owing to the absence of large towns,
the legislation existing has not been adopted. In Africa,
Australia and Canada the governments make grants to public
libraries up to a certain amount, on condition that the reading-rooms
are open to the public, and some of the legislatures are
even in closer touch with the libraries. The Canadian and
Australian libraries are administered more or less on American
lines, whilst those of South Africa, India, &amp;c., are managed on
the plan followed in England.</p>

<p class="pt1 center"><i>Africa.</i></p>

<p>There are several important libraries in South Africa, and
many small town libraries which used to receive a government
grant equal to the subscriptions of the members, but in no case
did such grants exceed £150 for any one library in one year.
These grants fluctuate considerably owing to the changes and
temper of successive governments, and since the last war they
have been considerably reduced everywhere. One of the oldest
libraries is the South African Public Library at Cape Town
established in 1818, which enjoys the copyright-privilege of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page561" id="page561"></a>561</span>
receiving a free copy of every publication issued in Cape Colony.
This library contains the great collection of colonial books
bequeathed by Sir George Grey. The libraries of the various
legislatures are perhaps the best supported and most important,
but mention should be made of the public libraries of Port
Elizabeth, Cape Colony, which published an excellent catalogue,
and the public libraries at Kimberley; Durban, Natal; Bloemfontein,
Orange River Colony; Bulawayo, Rhodesia; Johannesburg,
Transvaal; and the public and university libraries at Pretoria.
None of the libraries of North Africa are specially notable,
although there are considerable collections at Cairo and Algiers.</p>

<p class="pt1 center"><i>Australasia.</i></p>

<p>All the public libraries, mechanics&rsquo; institutes, schools of arts
and similar institutes receive aid from the government, either
in the form of grants of money or boxes of books sent from
some centre. The public library of New South Wales, Sydney
(1869), which includes the Mitchell Library of over 50,000 vols.,
now possesses a total of nearly 250,000 vols., and circulates
books to country libraries, lighthouses and teachers&rsquo; associations
to the number of about 20,000 vols. per annum. The public
library of Victoria, Melbourne (1853), with about 220,000 vols.,
also sends books to 443 country libraries of various kinds, which
among them possess 750,000 vols., and circulate annually considerably
over 2½ million vols. The university library at Melbourne
(1855) has over 20,000 vols., and the libraries connected
with the parliament and various learned societies are important.
The public library of South Australia, Adelaide, has about
75,000 vols., and is the centre for the distribution of books to
the institutes throughout the colony. These institutes possess
over 325,000 vols. There is a good public library at Brisbane,
Queensland, and there are a number of state-aided schools of
arts with libraries attached. The Library of Parliament in
Brisbane possesses over 40,000, and the Rockhampton School
of Arts has 10,000 vols. Western Australia has a public library
at Perth, which was established in 1887, and the small town
institutes are assisted as in the other colonies.</p>

<p>Tasmania has several good libraries in the larger towns, but
none of them had in 1910 taken advantage of the act passed in
1867 which gives municipalities practically unlimited powers
and means as far as the establishment and maintenance of
public libraries are concerned. At Hobart the Tasmanian
Public Library (1849) is one of the most important, with 25,000
vols.</p>

<p>New Zealand is well equipped with public libraries established
under acts dating from 1869 to 1877, as well as subscription,
college and government libraries. At Auckland the Free Public
Library (1880) has 50,000 vols., including Sir George Grey&rsquo;s
Australasian collection; the Canterbury Public Library,
Christchurch (1874), has 40,000 vols.; the University of Otago
Library, Dunedin (1872), 10,000 vols.; and the public library at
Wellington (1893) contains 20,000 vols.</p>

<p class="pt1 center"><i>India and the East.</i></p>

<p>Apart from government and royal libraries, there are many
college, society, subscription and others, both English and
oriental. It is impossible to do more than name a few of the
most notable. Lists of many of the libraries in private hands
including descriptions of their MS. contents have been issued by
the Indian government. At Calcutta the Sanskrit college has
1652 printed Sanskrit volumes and 2769 Sanskrit MSS., some as
old as the 14th century; there is also a large collection of Jain
MSS. The Arabic library attached to the Arabic department of
the Madrasa was founded about 1781, and now includes 731
printed volumes, 143 original MSS. and 151 copies; the English
library of the Anglo-Persian department dates from 1854, and
extends to 3254 vols. The library of the Asiatic Society of
Bengal was founded in 1784, and now contains 15,000 printed
vols., chiefly on eastern and philological subjects, with a valuable
collection of 9500 Arabic and Persian MSS.</p>

<p>At Bombay the library of the Bombay branch of the Royal
Asiatic Society, established in 1804 as the Literary Society of
Bengal, is now an excellent general and oriental collection of
75,000 printed vols. and MSS., described in printed catalogues.
The Moolla Feroze Library was bequeathed for public use by
Moolla Feroze, head priest of the Parsis of the Kudmi sect in
1831, and consisted chiefly of MSS., in Arabic and Persian on
history, philosophy and astronomy; some additions of English
and Gujarati works have been made, as well as of European
books on Zoroastrianism. The Native General Library (1845)
has 11,000 vols., and there are libraries attached to Elphinstone
College and the university of Bombay.</p>

<p>The library of Tippoo Sahib, consisting of 2000 MSS., fell into
the hands of the British, and a descriptive catalogue of them
by Charles Stewart was published at Cambridge in 1809, 4to.
A few were presented to public libraries in England, but
the majority were placed in the college of Fort William, then
recently established. The first volume, containing Persian and
Hindustani poetry, of the <i>Catalogue of the Libraries of the King of
Oudh</i>, by A. Sprenger, was published at Calcutta in 1854. The
compiler shortly afterwards left the Indian service, and no
measures were taken to complete the work. On the annexation
of the kingdom in 1856 the ex-king is believed to have taken
some of the most valuable MSS. to Calcutta, but the largest
portion was left behind at Lucknow. During the siege the
books were used to block up windows, &amp;c., and those which were
not destroyed were abandoned and plundered by the soldiers.
Many were burnt for fuel; a few, however, were rescued and
sold by auction, and of these some were purchased for the
Asiatic Society of Bengal.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most remarkable library in India is that of the r&#257;j&#257;
of Tanjore, which dates from the end of the 16th or beginning
of the 17th century, when Tanjore was under the rule of the
Telugu N&#257;iks, who collected Sanskrit MSS. written in the
Telugu character. In the 18th century the Mahrattas conquered
the country, and since that date the library increased but
slowly. By far the greater portion of the store was acquired by
Sharabhoj&#299; R&#257;j&#257; during a visit to Benares in 1820-1830; his
successor Sivaj&#299; added a few, but of inferior value. There are
now about 18,000 MSS. written in Devan&#257;gar&#299;, Nandin&#257;gar&#299;,
Telugu, Kannada, Granth&#299;, Malay&#257;lam, Bengal&#299;, Panj&#257;b&#299; or
Kashmir&#299;, and Uriya; 8000 are on palm leaves. Dr Burnell&rsquo;s
printed catalogue describes 12,375 articles.</p>

<p>The Royal Asiatic Society has branches with libraries attached
in many of the large cities of India, the Straits Settlements,
Ceylon, China, Japan, &amp;c. At Rangoon in Burma there are
several good libraries. The Raffles Library at Singapore was
established as a proprietary institution in 1844, taken over by
the government in 1874, and given legal status by an ordinance
passed in 1878. It now contains about 35,000 vols. in general
literature, but books relating to the Malayan peninsula and
archipelago have been made a special feature, and since the
acquisition of the collection of J. R. Logan in 1879 the library
has become remarkably rich in this department. In Ceylon
there is the Museum Library at Colombo (1877), which is maintained
by the government, and there are many subscription and
a few oriental libraries.</p>

<p class="pt1 center"><i>Canada.</i></p>

<p>The public libraries of the various provinces of Canada have
grown rapidly in importance and activity, and, assisted as they
are by government and municipal grants, they promise to rival
those of the United States in generous equipment. Most of the
library work in Canada is on the same lines as that of the United
States, and there are no special points of difference worth
mention. The library laws of the Dominion are embodied in a
series of acts dating from 1854, by which much the same powers
are conferred on local authorities as by the legislation of Britain
and the United States. An important feature of the Canadian
library law is the close association maintained between schools
and libraries, and in some provinces the school libraries are
established by the school and not the library laws. There is
also an important extension of libraries to the rural districts,
so that in every direction full provision is being made for the
after-school education and recreation of the people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page562" id="page562"></a>562</span></p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The province of Ontario has a very large and widespread library
system of which full particulars are given in the annual reports of the
minister of education. The library portion has been printed separately,
and with its illustrations and special articles forms quite a
handbook of Canadian library practice. There are now 413 public
libraries described as free and not free, and of these 131 free and 234
not free reported in 1909. The free libraries possessed 775,976 vols.
and issued 2,421,049 vols. The not free libraries, most of which
receive legislative or municipal grants, possessed 502,879 vols. and
issued 650,826 vols. This makes a grand total of 1,278,855 vols. in
municipal and assisted subscription libraries without counting the
university and other libraries in the province. The most important
other libraries in Ontario are&mdash;Queen&rsquo;s University, Kingston (1841),
40,000 vols.; Library of Parliament, Ottawa, about 250,000 vols.;
university of Ottawa, 35,000 vols.; Legislative Library of Ontario,
Toronto, about 100,000 vols.; university of Toronto (1856), 50,000
vols. The Public (municipal) Library of Toronto has now over
152,000 vols.</p>

<p>In the province of Quebec, in addition to the state-aided libraries
there are several large and important libraries, among which may be
mentioned the Fraser Institute, Montreal, 40,000 vols.; McGill
University, Montreal (1855), 125,000 vols., comprising many important
collections; the Seminary of St Sulpice, Montreal, about
80,000 vols.; Laval University, Quebec, 125,000 vols.; and the
library of the Legislature (1792), about 100,000 vols. In the western
provinces several large public, government and college libraries have
been formed, but none of them are as old and important as those in
the eastern provinces.</p>

<p>In Nova Scotia there are now 279 cases of books circulating among
the school libraries, containing about 40,000 vols., and in addition
2800 vols. were stocked for the use of rural school libraries. The
rural school libraries of Nova Scotia are regulated by a special law,
and a little handbook has been printed, somewhat similar to that
published by the French educational authorities for the communale
libraries. The Legislative Library at Halifax contains nearly 35,000
vols., and the Dalhousie University (1868), in the same town, contains
about 20,000 vols. The Legislative Library of Prince Edward
Island, Charlottetown, containing the Dodd Library, issues books for
home use. The school law of New Brunswick provides for grants
being made in aid of school libraries by the Board of Education equal
to one half the amount raised by a district, and a series of rules has
been published. The only other British libraries in America of much
consequence are those in the West Indian Islands. The Institute of
Jamaica, Kingston (1879) has about 15,000 vols.; the Trinidad
Public Library (1841), recently revised and catalogued, 23,000 vols.;
and there are a few small legislative and college libraries in addition.</p>

<p class="pt1 center"><i>United States of America.</i></p>

<p>The libraries of the United States are remarkable for their
number, size, variety, liberal endowment and good administration.
The total number of libraries with over 1000 vols. was
5383 in 1900, including those attached to schools and institutions,
and in 1910 there were probably at least 10,000 libraries having
1000 vols. and over. It is impossible to do more than glance
at the principal libraries and activities, where the field is so
immense, and a brief sketch of some of the chief federal, state,
university, endowed and municipal libraries will therefore be
presented.</p>

<p>The Library of Congress was first established in 1800 at
Washington, and was burned together with the Capitol by the
British army in 1814. President Jefferson&rsquo;s books
were purchased to form the foundation of a new
<span class="sidenote">Federal libraries.</span>
library, which continued to increase slowly until 1851,
when all but 20,000 vols. were destroyed by fire. From this
time the collection has grown rapidly, and now consists of
about 1,800,000 vols. In 1866 the library of the Smithsonian
Institution, consisting of 40,000 vols., chiefly in natural science,
was transferred to the Library of Congress. The library is
specially well provided in history, jurisprudence, the political
sciences and Americana. Since 1832 the law collections have
been constituted into a special department. This is the national
library. In 1870 the registry of copyrights was transferred to it
under the charge of the librarian of Congress, and two copies of
every publication which claims copyright are required to be
deposited. Cards for these are now printed and copies are sold
to other libraries for an annual subscription fixed according to
the number taken. The building in which the library is now
housed was opened in 1897. It covers 3½ acres of ground,
contains 10,000,000 cub. ft. of space, and has possible accommodation
for over 4 million vols. Its cost was $6,500,000, or
including the land, $7,000,000. It is the largest, most ornate
and most costly building in the world yet erected for library
purposes. Within recent years the appropriation has been
largely increased, and the bibliographical department has been
able to publish many valuable books on special subjects. The
<i>A.L.A. Catalog</i> (1904) and <i>A.L.A. Portrait Index</i> (1906), may
be mentioned as of especial value. The classification of the
library is being gradually completed, and in every respect this is
the most active government library in existence.</p>

<p>Other important federal libraries are those attached to the
following departments at Washington: Bureau of Education
(1868); Geological Survey (1882); House of Representatives;
Patent Office (1836); Senate (1868); Surgeon General&rsquo;s Office
(1870), with an elaborate analytical printed catalogue of world-wide
fame.</p>

<p>Although the state libraries of Pennsylvania and New Hampshire
are known to have been established as early as 1777, it
was not until some time after the revolution that any
general tendency was shown to form official libraries
<span class="sidenote">State libraries.</span>
in connexion with the state system. It is especially
within the last thirty years that the number of these libraries has
so increased that now every state and territory possesses a
collection of books and documents for official and public purposes.
These collections depend for their increase upon annual
appropriations by the several states, and upon a systematic
exchange of the official publications of the general government
and of the several states and territories. The largest is that of
the state of New York at Albany, which contains nearly 500,000
vols., and is composed of a general and a law library. Printed
and MS. card catalogues have been issued. The state libraries
are libraries of reference, and only members of the official classes
are allowed to borrow books, although any well-behaved person
is admitted to read in the libraries.</p>

<p>The earliest libraries formed were in connexion with educational
institutions, and the oldest is that of Harvard (1638).
It was destroyed by fire in 1764, but active steps were
at once taken for its restoration. From that time to
<span class="sidenote">University libraries.</span>
the present, private donations have been the great
resource of the library. In 1840 the collection was
removed to Gore Hall, erected for the purpose with a noble bequest
from Christopher Gore (1758-1829), formerly governor of
Massachusetts. There are also ten special libraries connected
with the different departments of the university. The total
numbers of vols. in all these collections is over 800,000. There is
a MS. card-catalogue in two parts, by authors and subjects,
which is accessible to the readers. The only condition of admission
to use the books in Gore Hall is respectability; but only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page563" id="page563"></a>563</span>
members of the university and privileged persons may borrow
books. The library of Yale College, New Haven, was founded
in 1701, but grew so slowly that, even with the 1000 vols. received
from Bishop Berkeley in 1733, it had only increased to 4000
vols. in 1766, and some of these were lost in the revolutionary
war. During the 19th century the collection grew more speedily,
and now the library numbers over 550,000 vols.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Other important university and college libraries are Amherst
College, Mass. (1821), 93,000 vols.; Brown University, R.I. (1767),
156,000 vols.; Columbia University, N.Y. (1763), 430,000 vols.;
Cornell University, N.Y. (1868), 355,000 vols.; Dartmouth College,
N.H. (1769), 106,000 vols.; Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore
(1876), 220,000 vols.; Lehigh University, Pa. (1877), 150,000 vols.;
Leland Stanford University, Cal. (1891), 113,000 vols.; Princeton
University, N.J. (1746), 260,000 vols.; University of California
(1868), 240,000 vols.; University of Chicago, Ill. (1892), 480,000
vols.; University of Michigan (1837), 252,000 vols.; University of
Pennsylvania (1749), 285,000 vols. There are numerous other college
libraries, several of them even larger than some of those named
above.</p>
</div>

<p>The establishment of proprietary or subscription libraries runs
back into the first half of the 18th century, and is connected
with the name of Benjamin Franklin. It was at
Philadelphia, in the year 1731, that he set on foot
<span class="sidenote">Subscription and Endowed Libraries.</span>
what he called &ldquo;his first project of a public nature, that
for a subscription library.... The institution soon
manifested its ability, was imitated by other towns and in
other provinces.&rdquo; The Library Company of Philadelphia was
soon regularly incorporated, and gradually drew to itself other
collections of books, including the Loganian Library, which
was vested in the company by the state legislature in 1792 in
trust for public use. Hence the collection combines the character
of a public and of a proprietary library, being freely open for
reference purposes, while the books circulate only among the
subscribing members. It numbers at present 226,000 vols., of
which 11,000 belong to the Loganian Library, and may be
freely lent. In 1869 Dr James Rush left a bequest of over one
million dollars for the purpose of erecting a building to be called
the Ridgeway branch of the library. The building is very
handsome, and has been very highly spoken of as a library
structure. Philadelphia has another large proprietary library&mdash;that
of the Mercantile Library Company, which was established
in 1821. It possesses 200,000 vols., and its members have
always enjoyed direct access to the shelves. The library of the
Boston Athenaeum was established in 1807, and numbers
235,000 vols. It has published an admirable dictionary-catalogue.
The collection is especially rich in art and in history, and
possesses a part of the library of George Washington. The
Mercantile Library Association of New York, which was founded
in 1820, has over 240,000 vols. New York possesses two other
large proprietary libraries, one of which claims to have been
formed as early as 1700 as the &ldquo;public&rdquo; library of New York.
It was organized as the New York Society Library in 1754, and
has been especially the library of the old Knickerbocker families
and their descendants, its contents bearing witness to its history.
It contains about 100,000 vols. The Apprentices&rsquo; Library
(1820) has about 100,000 vols., and makes a special feature of
works on trades and useful arts.</p>

<p>The Astor Library in New York was founded by a bequest of
John Jacob Astor, whose example was followed successively
by his son and grandson. The library was opened to the public
in 1854, and consists of a careful selection of the most valuable
books upon all subjects. It is a library of reference, for which
purpose it is freely open, and books are not lent out. It is &ldquo;a
working library for studious persons.&rdquo; The Lenox Library was
established by James Lenox in 1870, when a body of trustees
was incorporated by an act of the legislature. In addition to
the funds intended for the library building and endowment,
amounting to $1,247,000, the private collection of books which
Mr Lenox had long been accumulating is extremely valuable.
Though it does not rank high in point of mere numbers, it is
exceedingly rich in early books on America, in Bibles, in Shakesperiana
and in Elizabethan poetry. Both those libraries are
now merged in the New York Public Library. The Peabody
Institute at Baltimore was established by George Peabody
in 1857, and contains a reference library open to all comers.
The institute has an endowment of $1,000,000, which, however,
has to support, besides the library, a conservatoire of music, an
art gallery, and courses of popular lectures. It has a very fine
printed dictionary catalogue and now contains nearly 200,000
vols. In the same city is the Enoch Pratt Free Library (1882)
with 257,000 vols. In the city of Chicago are two very important
endowed libraries, the Newberry Library (1887) with
over 200,000 vols., and the John Crerar Library (1894), with
235,000 vols. Both of these are reference libraries of great
value, and the John Crerar Library specializes in science, for
which purpose its founder left $3,000,000.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>It will be sufficient to name a few of the other endowed libraries
to give an idea of the large number of donors who have given money
to libraries. Silas Bronson (Waterbury), Annie T. Howard (New
Orleans), Joshua Bates (Boston), Charles E. Forbes (Northampton,
Mass.), Mortimer F. Reynolds (Rochester, N.Y.), Leonard Case
(Cleveland), I. Osterhout (Wilkes-Barré, Pa.), and above all Andrew
Carnegie, whose library benefactions exceed $53,000,000.</p>

<p>It remains to mention another group of proprietary and society
libraries.</p>

<p>Since the organization of the government in 1789, no less than
one hundred and sixty historical societies have been formed in
the United States, most of which still continue to exist. Many of
them have formed considerable libraries, and possess extensive
and valuable manuscript collections. The oldest of them is the
Massachusetts Historical Society, which dates from 1791.</p>

<p>The earliest of the scientific societies, the American Philosophical
Society (1743), has 73,000 vols. The most extensive collection is that
of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, which consists
of 80,000 vols. and pamphlets. For information as to the numerous
professional libraries of the United States&mdash;theological, legal and
medical&mdash;the reader may be referred to the authorities quoted below.</p>
</div>

<p>In no country has the movement for the development of
municipal libraries made such progress as in the United States;
these institutions called free or public as the case may
be are distinguished for their work, enterprise and the
<span class="sidenote">Municipal Libraries.</span>
liberality with which they are supported. They are
established under laws passed by the different states, the
first to pass such an enactment being Massachusetts, which
in 1848 empowered the city of Boston to establish a free
public library. This was subsequently extended to the whole
state in 1851. Other states followed, all with more or less
variation in the provisions, till practically every state in the
Union now has a body of library laws. In general the American
library law is much on the same lines as the English. In most
states the acts are permissive. In New Hampshire aid
is granted by the state to any library for which a township
contracts to make a definite annual appropriation.
A limit is imposed in most states on the library tax which may
be levied, although there are some, like Massachusetts and New
Hampshire, which fix no limit. In every American town the
amount derived from the library tax usually exceeds by double
or more the same rate raised in Britain in towns of similar
size. For example, East Orange, N.J., with a population of
35,000, expends £2400, while Dumfries in Scotland, with 23,000
pop. expends £500. Cincinnati, 345,000 pop., expenditure
£26,000; Islington (London), 350,000 pop., expenditure £8200,
is another example. In the smaller towns the difference is not
so marked, but generally the average American municipal
library income is considerably in excess of the British one.
Many American municipal libraries have also endowments
which add to their incomes.</p>

<p>In one respect the American libraries differ from those of the
United Kingdom. They are usually managed by a small committee
or body of trustees, about five or more in
number, who administer the library independent of
<span class="sidenote">American Library Administration.</span>
the city council. This is akin to the practice in
Scotland, although there, the committees are larger.
In addition to the legislation authorizing town libraries to be
established, thirty-two states have formed state library commissions.
These are small bodies of three or five trained persons
appointed by the different states which, acting on behalf of the
state, encourage the formation of local libraries, particularly in
towns and villages, and in many cases have authority to aid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page564" id="page564"></a>564</span>
their establishment by the grant out of the state funds of a
certain sum (usually $100) towards the purchase of books, upon
the appropriation of a similar sum by the local authorities.
These commissions are prepared to aid further with select lists
of desirable books, and with suggestions or advice in the
problems of construction and maintenance. Such commissions
are in existence in Alabama, California, Colorado, Connecticut,
Delaware, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas,
Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri,
Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North
Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee,
Texas, Utah, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin.</p>

<p>The reports and other documents issued by some of these
commissioners are very interesting and valuable, especially as
regards the light they throw on the working of the travelling
libraries in country districts. These to some extent are a
revival of the &ldquo;itinerating&rdquo; library idea of Samuel Brown of
Haddington in Scotland, who from 1817 to 1836 carried on
a system of travelling subscription libraries in that country.
At the time of his death there were 3850 vols. in 47 libraries.
The American travelling libraries, often under state supervision,
are well organized and numerous, and the books are circulated
free. New York was the pioneer in this movement which
now extends to most of the states which have established
library commissions. There are also town travelling libraries
and deposit stations in addition to branches, so that every
effort is made to bring people in outlying districts into touch
with books.</p>

<p>The municipal libraries of the United States work in conjunction
with the schools, and it is generally considered that
they are part of the educational machinery of the country.
In the case of New York the state libraries have been put under
the control of the university of the state of New York, which
also inaugurated the travelling libraries. Work with the schools
and children generally is more cultivated in the libraries of the
United States than elsewhere. In some cases the libraries send
collections of books to the schools; in others provision is made
for children&rsquo;s reading-rooms and lending departments at the
library buildings. At Cleveland (Ohio), Pittsburg (Pa.), New
York and many other places, elaborate arrangements are in
force for the convenience and amusement of children. There
is a special school, the Carnegie Library training school for
children&rsquo;s librarians, at Pittsburg, and within recent years the
instruction has included the art of telling stories to children at
the libraries. This &ldquo;story-hour&rdquo; idea has been the cause of
considerable discussion in the United States, librarians and
teachers being divided in opinion as to the value of the service.
The chief factors in children&rsquo;s work in American libraries, often
overlooked by critics, are the number of non-English reading
adults and the large number of children of foreign origin. The
adults do not use the libraries to any large extent, but the
children, who learn English at the schools, are brought into
close touch with the juvenile departments of the libraries. In
this way many libraries are obliged to undertake special work
for children, and as a rule it is performed in a sane, practical
and economical manner. The preponderance of women librarians
and their natural sentimental regard for children has tended
to make this work loom rather largely in some quarters, but with
these exceptions the activity on behalf of children is justified
on many grounds. But above all, it is manifest that a rapidly
growing nation, finding homes for thousands of foreigners and
their children annually, must use every means of rapidly
educating their new citizens, and the public library is one of the
most efficient and ready ways of accomplishing this great
national object.</p>

<p>With regard to methods, the American libraries are working
on much the same plan as those of the United Kingdom. They
allow access to the shelves more universally, and there is much
more standardization in classification and other internal matters.
The provision of books is more profuse, although there is, on the
whole, more reading done in the United Kingdom. The largest
municipal library system in America, and also in the world, is
that of New York City, which, after struggling with a series of
Free Circulating Libraries, blossomed out in 1895 into the
series of combinations which resulted in the present great
establishment. In that year, the Astor and Lenox libraries (see
above) were taken over by the city, and in addition, $2,000,000
was given by one of the heirs of Mr S. J. Tilden, who had bequeathed
about $4,000,000 for library purposes in New York
but whose will had been upset in the law courts. In 1901
Mr Andrew Carnegie gave about £1,500,000 for the purpose
of providing 65 branches, and these are now nearly all erected.
A very fine central library building has been erected, and when
the organization is completed there will be no system of
municipal libraries to equal that of New York. It possesses
about 1,400,000 vols. in the consolidated libraries. Brooklyn,
although forming part of Greater New York, has an independent
library system, and possesses about 560,000, vols.
distributed among 26 branches and including the old Brooklyn
Library which has been absorbed in the municipal library
system. At Boston (Mass.) is one of the most renowned public
libraries in the United States, and also the oldest established
by act of legislature. It was first opened to the public in
1854, and is now housed in a very magnificently decorated
building which was completed in 1895. The central library
contains many fine special collections, and there are 28 branch
and numerous school libraries in connexion. It possesses
about 1,000,000 vols. altogether, its annual circulation is about
1,500,000 vols., and its annual expenditure is nearly £70,000.</p>

<p class="pt1 center"><i>France.</i></p>

<p>French libraries (other than those in private hands) belong
either to the state, to the departments, to the communes, or to
learned societies, educational establishments and other public
institutions; the libraries of judicial or administrative bodies are
not considered to be owned by them, but to be state property.
Besides the unrivalled library accommodation of the capital,
France possesses a remarkable assemblage of provincial libraries.
The communal and school libraries also form striking features of
the French free library system. Taking as a basis for comparison
the <i>Tableau statistique des bibliothèques publiques</i> (1857),
there were at that date 340 departmental libraries with a
total of 3,734,260 vols., and 44,436 MSS. In 1908 the number
of volumes in all the public libraries; communal, university,
learned societies, educational and departmental, was more than
20,060,148 vols., 93,986 MSS. and 15,530 incunabula. Paris
alone now possesses over 10,570,000 printed vols., 147,543 MSS.,
5000 incunabula, 609,439 maps and plans, 2,000,000 prints
(designs and reproductions).</p>

<p>The Bibliothèque Nationale (one of the most extensive libraries
in the world) has had an advantage over others in the length
of time during which its contents have been accumulating,
and in the great zeal shown for it by several
<span class="sidenote">Paris.</span>
kings and other eminent men. Enthusiastic writers find the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page565" id="page565"></a>565</span>
original of this library in the MS. collections of Charlemagne and
Charles the Bald, but these were dispersed in course of time, and
the few precious relics of them which the national library now
possesses have been acquired at a much later date. Of the
library which St Louis formed in the 13th century (in imitation
of what he had seen in the East) nothing has fallen into the
possession of the Bibliothèque Nationale, but much has remained
of the royal collections made by kings of the later dynasties.
The real foundation of the institution (formerly known as the
Bibliothèque du Roi) may be said to date from the reign of King
John, the Black Prince&rsquo;s captive, who had a considerable taste
for books, and bequeathed his &ldquo;royal library&rdquo; of MSS. to his
successor Charles V. Charles V. organized his library in a very
effective manner, removing it from the Palais de la Cité to the
Louvre, where it was arranged on desks in a large hall of three
storeys, and placed under the management of the first librarian
and cataloguer, Claude Mallet, the king&rsquo;s valet-de-chambre.
His catalogue was a mere shelf-list, entitled <i>Inventaire des Livres
du Roy nostre Seigneur estans au chastel du Louvre</i>; it is still
extant, as well as the further inventories made by Jean Blanchet
in 1380, and by Jean le Bègue in 1411 and 1424. Charles V.
was very liberal in his patronage of literature, and many of the
early monuments of the French language are due to his having
employed Nicholas Oresme, Ràoul de Presle and other scholars
to make translations from ancient texts. Charles VI. added some
hundreds of MSS. to the royal library, which, however, was
sold to the regent, duke of Bedford, after a valuation had been
established by the inventory of 1424. The regent transferred it
to England, and it was finally dispersed at his death in 1435.
Charles VII. and Louis XI. did little to repair the loss of the
precious Louvre library, but the news of the invention of printing
served as a stimulus to the creation of another one, of which the
first librarian was Laurent Paulmier. The famous miniaturist,
Jean Foucquet of Tours, was named the king&rsquo;s <i>enlumineur</i>, and
although Louis XI. neglected to avail himself of many precious
opportunities that occurred in his reign, still the new library
developed gradually with the help of confiscation. Charles VIII.
enriched it with many fine MSS. executed by his order, and
also with most of the books that had formed the library of the
kings of Aragon, seized by him at Naples. Louis XII., on
coming to the throne, incorporated the Bibliothèque du Roi
with the fine Orleans library at Blois, which he had inherited.
The Blois library, thus augmented, and further enriched by
plunder from the palaces of Pavia, and by the purchase of the
famous Gruthuyse collection, was described at the time as one of
the four marvels of France. Francis I. removed it to Fontainebleau
in 1534, enlarged by the addition of his private library.
He was the first to set the fashion of fine artistic bindings, which
was still more cultivated by Henry II., and which has never
died out in France. During the librarianship of Amyot (the
translator of Plutarch) the library was transferred from Fontainebleau
to Paris, not without the loss of several books coveted by
powerful thieves. Henry IV. removed it to the Collége de
Clermont, but in 1604 another change was made, and in 1622
it was installed in the Rue de la Harpe. Under the librarianship
of J. A. de Thou it acquired the library of Catherine de&rsquo; Medici,
and the glorious Bible of Charles the Bald. In 1617 a decree was
passed that two copies of every new publication should be
deposited in the library, but this was not rigidly enforced till
Louis XIV.&rsquo;s time. The first catalogue worthy of the name
was finished in 1622, and contains a description of some 6000
vols., chiefly MSS. Many additions were made during Louis
XIII.&rsquo;s reign, notably that of the Dupuy collection, but a new
era dawned for the Bibliothèque du Roi under the patronage of
Louis XIV. The enlightened activity of Colbert, one of the
greatest of collectors, so enriched the library that it became
necessary for want of space to make another removal. It was
therefore in 1666 installed in the Rue Vivien (now Vivienne) not
far from its present habitat. The departments of engravings
and medals were now created, and before long rose to nearly
equal importance with that of books. Marolles&rsquo;s prints, Foucquet&rsquo;s
books, and many from the Mazarin library were added to
the collection, and, in short, the Bibliothèque du Roi had its
future pre-eminence undoubtedly secured. Nic. Clément made
a catalogue in 1684 according to an arrangement which has been
followed ever since (that is, in twenty-three classes, each one
designated by a letter of the alphabet), with an alphabetical index
to it. After Colbert&rsquo;s death Louvois emulated his predecessor&rsquo;s
labours, and employed Mabillon, Thevenot and others to procure
fresh accessions from all parts of the world. A new catalogue
was compiled in 1688 in 8 vols, by several distinguished scholars.
The Abbé Louvois, the minister&rsquo;s son, became head of the library
in 1691, and opened it to all students&mdash;a privilege which although
soon withdrawn was afterwards restored. Towards the end of
Louis XIV.&rsquo;s reign it contained over 70,000 vols. Under the
management of the Abbé Bignon numerous additions were made
in all departments, and the library was removed to its present
home in the Rue Richelieu. Among the more important acquisitions
were 6000 MSS. from the private library of the Colbert
family, Bishop Huet&rsquo;s forfeited collection, and a large number
of Oriental books imported by missionaries from the farther East,
and by special agents from the Levant. Between 1739 and 1753
a catalogue in 11 vols, was printed, which enabled the administration
to discover and to sell its duplicates. In Louis XVI.&rsquo;s
reign the sale of the La Vallière library furnished a valuable
increase both in MSS. and printed books. A few years before
the Revolution broke out the latter department contained over
300,000 vols, and opuscules. The Revolution was serviceable
to the library, now called the Bibliothèque Nationale, by increasing
it with the forfeited collections of the <i>émigrés</i>, as well as
of the suppressed religious communities. In the midst of the
difficulties of placing and cataloguing these numerous acquisitions,
the name of Van Praet appears as an administrator of the first
order. Napoleon increased the amount of the government grant;
and by the strict enforcement of the law concerning new publications,
as well as by the acquisition of several special collections,
the Bibliothèque made considerable progress during his reign
towards realizing his idea that it should be universal in character.
At the beginning of last century the recorded numbers were
250,000 printed vols., 83,000 MSS., and 1,500,000 engravings.
After Napoleon&rsquo;s downfall the MSS. which he had transferred
from Berlin, Hanover, Florence, Venice, Rome, the Hague and
other places had to be returned to their proper owners. The
MacCarthy sale in 1817 brought a rich store of MSS. and
incunabula. From that time onwards to the present, under the
enlightened administration of MM. Taschereau and Delisle and
Marcel, the accessions have been very extensive.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>According to the statistics for 1908 the riches of the Bibliothèque
Nationale may be enumerated as follows: (1) Département des
Imprimés: more than 3,000,000 vols.; Maps and plans, 500,000
in 28,000 vols. (2) Département des Manuscrits: 110,000 MSS.
thus divided: Greek 4960, Latin 21,544, French 44,913, Oriental and
miscellaneous 38,583. (3) Département des Estampes: 1,000,000
pieces. (4) Département des Médailles: 207,096 pieces.</p>

<p>Admittance to the &ldquo;salle de travail&rdquo; is obtained through a card
procured from the secretarial office; the &ldquo;salle publique&rdquo; contains
344 places for readers, who are able to consult more than 50,000 vols.
of books of reference. Great improvements have lately been introduced
into the service. A &ldquo;salle de lecture publique&rdquo; is free to all
readers and is much used. New buildings are in process of construction.
The slip catalogue bound in volumes dates from 1882 and
gives a list of all accessions since that date; it is divided into two
parts, one for the names of authors and the other for subjects. There
is not yet, as at the British Museum, an alphabetical catalogue of all
the printed works and kept up by periodical supplements, but since
1897 a <i>Catalogue général des livres imprimés</i> has been begun. In
1909 the 38th vol. containing letters A to Delp had appeared.
Some volumes are published each year, but the earlier volumes only
contain a selection of the books; this inconvenience has now been
remedied. Among the other catalogues published by the Printed
Book Department, the following may be mentioned: <i>Répertoire
alphabétique des livres mis à la disposition des lecteurs dans la salle de
travail</i> (1896, 8vo), <i>Liste des périodiques français et étrangers mis à la
disposition des lecteurs</i> (1907, 4to, autogr.), <i>Liste des périodiques
étrangers</i> (new ed., 1896, 8vo) and <i>Supplement</i> (1902, 8vo), <i>Bulletin
des récentes publications françaises</i> (from 1882, 8vo), <i>Catalogue des
dissertations et écrits académiques provenant des échanges avec les
universités étrangères</i> (from 1882, 8vo). The other extensive catalogues
apart from those of the 18th century are: <i>Catalogue de
l&rsquo;histoire de France</i> (1885-1889, 4to, 11 vols.); <i>Table des auteurs,</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page566" id="page566"></a>566</span>

section there is L. Vallée&rsquo;s <i>Catalogue des cartes et plans relatifs à
Paris et aux environs de Paris</i> (1908, 8vo). The following should be
mentioned: <i>Bibliographie générale des travaux historiques et archéologiques
publiés par les sociétés savantes de la France</i>, par R. de
Lasteyrie avec la collaboration d&rsquo;E. Lefèvre-Pontalis, S. Bougenot,
A. Vidier, t. i.-vi. (1885-1908, 4to). The scientific division of this
work (in two parts) is by Deniker. The printed catalogues and the
autographed and manuscript lists of the Département des Manuscrits
are very numerous and greatly facilitate research. For the
French there are: H. Omont, <i>Catalogue général des manuscrits
français</i> (1895-1897, 9 vols. 8vo); H. Omont, <i>Nouvelles acquisitions</i>
(continuation of the same catalogue, 1899-1900, 3 vols. 8vo); H.
Omont, <i>Anciens Inventaires de la Bibliothèque Nationale</i> (1908-1909,
2 vols. 8vo); E. Coyecque, <i>Inventaire de la Collection Anisson sur
l&rsquo;histoire de l&rsquo;imprimerie et de la librairie</i> (1900, 2 vols. 8vo). Without
repeating the catalogues mentioned in the tenth edition of the
<i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i>, it is yet necessary to mention the following:
<i>Catalogue de la collection Baluze</i>; <i>Inventaire des sceaux de
la collection Clairambault</i>; <i>Catalogue de la collection des cinq-cents
et des mélanges Colbert</i>; <i>Catalogue des collections Duchesne et de
Bréquigny</i>; those of the Dupuy, Joly de Fleury, and Moreau collections,
and that of provincial history, &amp;c. For the Greek collection
the most important catalogues have been made by H. Omont, the
present Keeper of the Manuscripts, and these are: <i>Inventaire sommaire
des MSS. grecs</i> (1886-1898, 4 vols. 8vo); <i>Catalogus codicum
hagiographicorum graecorum</i> (1896, 8vo); <i>Facsimilés des plus
anciens MSS. grecs en onciale et en minuscule du IX<span class="sp">e</span> au XIV<span class="sp">e</span> siècle</i>
(1891, fol.); as well as <i>Description des peintures et autres ornements
contenus dans les MSS. latins</i>, par H. Bordier (1883, 4to). The lists
of the Latin MSS. are: <i>Inventaire des manuscrits latins et nouvelles
acquisitions jusqu&rsquo;en 1874</i> (1863-1874, 7 pts. 8vo) and <i>Manuscrits
latins et français ajoutés aux fonds des nouvelles acquisitions 1875-1881</i>
(1891, 2 vols. 8vo), by M. Delisle; M. Omont published <i>Nouvelles
Acquisitions du département des manuscrits</i> (1892-1907, 8 pts. 8vo),
and B. Haureau, <i>Notices et extraits de quelques manuscrits latins</i>
(1890-1893, 6 vols. 8vo). The principal modern catalogues of the
oriental collection are: B. de Slane, <i>Catalogue des MSS. arabes, avec
supplément</i> (1883-1895, 4to); E. Blochet, <i>Catalogue des MSS.
arabes, persans, et turcs de la collection Schefer</i> (1900); E. Blochet,
<i>Inventaire des MSS. arabes de la collection Decourtemanche</i> (1906); F.

(1887); <i>MSS. syriaques et sabéens</i> (1874-1896); <i>MSS. thibétains</i> (in
the press), &amp;c. The catalogues of manuscripts in modern languages
are nearly all completed. The Départements des Médailles et des
Estampes possess excellent catalogues, and the following should be
mentioned: E. Babelon, <i>Catalogue des monnaies grecques</i> (1890-1893);
E. Babelon, <i>Inventaire sommaire de la collection Waddington</i>
(1898); <i>Médailles fausses recueillies</i>, par Hoffmann (1902); Muret et

<p>The Bibliothèque de l&rsquo;Arsenal was founded by the marquis
de Paulmy (Antoine-René d&rsquo;Argenson) in the 18th century; it
received in 1786 80,000 vols. from the duc de La Vallière. Before
its confiscation as national property it had belonged to the
comte d&rsquo;Artois, who had bought it from the marquis de Paulmy
in his lifetime. It contains at the present time about 600,000
vols., 10,000 manuscripts, 120,000 prints and the Bastille
collection (2500 portfolios) of which the inventory is complete;
it is the richest library for the literary history of France and has
more than 30,000 theatrical pieces.</p>

<p>The Bibliothèque Mazarine owes its origin to the great cardinal,
who confided the direction to Gabriel Naudé; it was open to the
public in 1642, and was transferred to Rue de Richelieu in
1648. Dispersed during the Fronde in the lifetime of Mazarin,
it was reconstituted after the death of the cardinal in 1661,
when it contained 40,000 vols. which were left to the Collège des
Quatre-Nations, which in 1691 made it again public. It now has
250,000 vols.; with excellent manuscript catalogues.</p>

<p>The first library of the Genovéfains had nearly disappeared
owing to bad administration when Cardinal François de la
Rochefoucauld, who had charge of the reformation of that religious
order, constituted in 1642 a new library with his own
books. The Bibliothèque Ste-Geneviève in 1716 possessed
45,000 vols.; important gifts were made by Letellier in 1791,
and the duc d&rsquo;Orléans increased it still more. It became
national property in 1791, and was called the Bibliothèque du
Panthéon and added to the Lycée Henri IV. under the empire.
In 1908 the library contained 350,000 printed vols., 1225 incunabula,
3510 manuscripts, 10,000 prints (including 7357 portraits
and 3000 maps and plans).</p>

<p>The Bibliothèque du Ministère des affaires étrangères was founded
by the marquis de Torcy, minister for foreign affairs under Louis
XIV.; it contains 80,000 vols. and is for official use only. The
Bibliothèque du Ministère de l&rsquo;Agriculture dates from 1882 and has
only 4000 vols. At the Ministry for the Colonies the library (of
10,000 vols.) dates from 1897; the catalogue was published in 1905;
the library of the Colonial office is attached to this ministry; suppressed
in 1896, it was re-established in 1899, and now contains 6000
vols., 7400 periodicals and 5000 photographs; it is open to the
public. There are 30,000 vols. in the Bibliothèque du Ministère du
commerce et de l&rsquo;industrie; the Bibliothèque du Ministère des
finances was burnt at the Commune, but has been reconstituted and
now contains 35,000 vols.; connected with it are the libraries of the
following offices: Contributions directes, Contributions indirectes,
Enregistrement et inspection des finances; the contents of these

(<i>Catalogue des manuscrits</i>, by E. Coyecque et H. Debray, 1907;
<i>Catalogue des livres de jurisprudence, d&rsquo;économie politique, de finances,
et d&rsquo;administration</i>, 1883). The Bibliothèque du Sénat (1818)
contains 150,000 vols, and 1343 MSS. The Bibliothèque du Conseil
d&rsquo;État has 30,000 vols. All these libraries are only accessible to
officials except by special permission.</p>

<p>The Bibliothèque Historique de la ville de Paris was destroyed in
1871, but Jules Cousin reconstituted it in 1872; it possesses 400,000
vols., 3500 MSS. and 14,000 prints; the principal printed catalogues
are <i>Catalogue des imprimés de la Réserve</i> by M. Poète (1910), <i>Catalogue
des manuscrits</i>, by F. Bournon (1893); a <i>Bulletin</i> has been issued
periodically since 1906. The Bibliothèque administrative de la
préfecture de la Seine is divided into two sections: French (40,000
vols.) and foreign (22,000 vols.); it is only accessible to officials and
to persons having a card of introduction; the catalogues are printed.</p>

<p>The other libraries connected with the city of Paris are that of the

22 Hospitals (92,887 vols.), the Préfecture de police (10,000 vols.),
the Bibliothèque Forney (10,000 vols. and 80,000 prints), the five
Écoles municipales supérieures (19,700 vols.), the six professional
schools (14,200 vols.).</p>

<p>The libraries of the university and the institutions dealing with
higher education in Paris are well organized and their catalogues
generally printed.</p>

<p>The Bibliothèque de l&rsquo;Université, although at present grouped as
a system in four sections in different places, historically considered
is the library of the Sorbonne. This was founded in 1762 by Montempuis
and only included the faculties of Arts and Theology. It
changed its name several times; in 1800 it was the Bibliothèque
du Prytanée, in 1808 Bibliothèque des Quatre Lycées and in 1812
Bibliothèque de l&rsquo;Université de France. The sections into which the
Bibliothèque de l&rsquo;Université is now divided are: (1) Facultés de
Sciences et des Lettres à la Sorbonne, (2) Faculté de Médecine, (3)
Faculté de droit, (4) École supérieure de pharmacie. Before the
separation of Church and State there was a fifth section, that of
Protestant theology. After the Bibliothèque nationale it is the
richest in special collections, and above all as regards classical philology,
archaeology, French and foreign literature and literary
criticism, just as the library of the Faculté des Sciences et des
Lettres is notable for philosophy, mathematics and chemico-physical
sciences. The great development which has taken place during the
last thirty years, especially under the administration of M. J. de
Chantepie du Dézert, its installation since 1897 in the buildings of
the New Sorbonne, have made it a library of the very first rank.
The reading-room only seats about 300 persons. The average attendance
per day is 1200, the number of books consulted varies from
1500 to 3000 vols. a day, and the loans amount to 14,000 vols. per
year. The store-rooms, although they contain more than 1200
mètres of shelves and comprise two buildings of five storeys each, are
insufficient for the annual accessions, which reach nearly 10,000 vols.
by purchase and presentation. Amongst the latter the most important
are the bequests of Leclerc, Peccot, Lavisse, Derenbourg and
Beljame; the last-named bequeathed more than 3000 vols., including
an important Shakespearean library. The first section contains more
than 550,000 vols., 2800 periodicals which include over 70,000 vols.,
320 incunabula, 2106 MSS., more than 2000 maps and plans and
some prints. The alphabetical catalogues are kept up day by day
on slips. The classified catalogues were in 1910 almost ready for
printing, and some had already been published: Périodiques (1905);
Cartulaires (1907); <i>Mélanges jubilaires et publications commémoratives</i>
(1908); <i>Inventaires des MSS.</i>, by E. Chatelain (1892); <i>Incunables</i>,
by E. Chatelain (1902); and <i>Supplément, Réserve de la bibliothèque</i>
1401-1540, by Ch. Beaulieux (1909); <i>Nouvelles acquisitions</i>
(1905-1908); <i>Catalogue des livres de G. Duplessis donnés à l&rsquo;Université
de Paris</i> (1907), <i>Catalogue collectif des bibliothèques universitaires</i>
by Fécamp (1898-1901). For French thèses, of which the
library possesses a rich collection, the catalogues are as follows:
Mourier et Deltour, <i>Catalogue des thèses de lettres</i> (1809, &amp;c.); A.
Maire, <i>Répertoire des thèses de lettres</i> (1809-1900); A. Maire, <i>Catalogue
des thèses de sciences</i> (1809-1890) with <i>Supplément</i> to 1900 by
Estanave; <i>Catalogue des thèses publié par le Ministère de l&rsquo;Instruction
publique</i> (1882, &amp;c.).</p>

<p>At the Sorbonne are also to be found the libraries of A. Dumont and
V. Cousin (15,000 vols.), and those of the laboratories, of which the
richest is the geological (30,000 specimens and books). The section
relating to medicine, housed since 1891 in the new buildings of the
Faculté de Médecine, includes 180,000 vols, and 88 MSS. (catalogue
1910). The Bibliothèque de la faculté de droit dates from 1772
and contains 80,000 vols., 239 MSS. The fourth section, l&rsquo;École
supérieure de pharmacie, greatly developed since 1882, now contains
50,000 vols.</p>

<p>The other libraries connected with higher education include that
of the École des Beaux-Arts (40,000 vols., 100,000 reproductions,
14,000 drawings). The library of the École normale supérieure
(1794), established in the Rue d&rsquo;Ulm in 1846, has received legacies
from Verdet (1867), Caboche (1887), Lerambert-Whitcomb (1890),
and a portion of Cuvier&rsquo;s library; the system of classification in use is
practically the same as that of the Sorbonne, being devised by
Philippe Lebas (librarian of the Sorbonne) about 1845; there are
200,000 vols. The library of the Muséum d&rsquo;histoire naturelle dates
from the 18th century, and contains 220,000 vols., 2000 MSS., 8000
original drawings on vellum beginning in 1631. The Bibliothèque
de l&rsquo;Office et Musée de l&rsquo;Instruction publique (formerly Musée
pédagogique), founded only in 1880, has 75,000 vols. In 1760 was
founded the Bibliothèque de l&rsquo;Institut de France, which is very rich;
its acquisitions come particularly from gifts and exchanges (400,000
vols., numerous and scarce; valuable MSS., especially modern ones).</p>

<p>The following may be briefly mentioned: Conservatoire national
de musique (1775), which receives everything published in France
relating to music (200,000 vols.); the Bibliothèque du théâtre de

founded in 1860 (60,000 vols., with a printed catalogue).</p>
</div>

<p>Before the Revolution there were in Paris alone 1100 libraries
containing altogether 2,000,000 vols. After the suppression of
the religious orders the libraries were confiscated, and in 1791
more than 800,000 vols, were seized in 162 religious houses and
transferred to eight literary foundations in accordance with a
decree of November 14, 1789. In the provinces 6,000,000 vols.
were seized and transferred to local depositories. The organization
of the central libraries under the decree of 3 Brumaire An
IV. (October 25, 1795) came to nothing, but the consular edict
of January 28, 1803 gave definitive organization to the books in
the local depositories. From that time the library system was
reconstituted, alike in Paris and the provinces. Unfortunately
many precious books and MSS. were burnt, since by the decree
of 4 Brumaire An II. (October 25, 1793) the Committee of Instruction
ordered, on the proposition of its president the deputy
Romme, the destruction or modification of books and objects
of art, under the pretext that they recalled the outward signs of
feudalism.</p>

<p>The books in the provincial libraries, not including those in
private hands or belonging to societies, number over 9,200,000
vols., 15,540 incunabula and 93,986 MSS. The number in the
colonies and protected states outside France is uncertain, but
<span class="sidenote">Libraries of the Departments.</span>
it extends to more than 200,000 vols.; to this number must be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page568" id="page568"></a>568</span>
added the 2,428,954 vols. contained in the university libraries.
There are over 300 departmental libraries, and as many
belong to learned societies. The increase in the
provincial libraries is slower than that of the Parisian
collections. With the exception of 26 libraries connected
specially with the state, the others are municipal
and are administered under state control by municipal librarians.
The original foundation of most of the libraries dates but a short
time before the Revolution, but there are a few exceptions.
Thus the Bibliothèque d&rsquo;Angers owes its first collection to Alain
de la Rue about 1376; it now contains 72,485 vols., 134 incunabula
and 2039 MSS. That of Bourges dates from 1466 (36,856
vols., 325 incunabula, 741 MSS.). The library of Carpentras was
established by Michel Anglici between 1452 and 1474 (50,000
vols., 2154 MSS.). Mathieu de la Porte is said to be the founder
of the library at Clermont-Ferrand at the end of the 15th century;
it contained rather more than 49,000 vols. at the time of its
union with the Bibliothèque Universitaire.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Amongst the libraries which date from the 16th century must be
mentioned that at Lyons founded by François I. in 1527; it possesses
113,168 vols., 870 incunabula and 5243 MSS. That of the Palais des
Arts has 82,079 vols., 64 incunabula and 311 MSS.</p>

<p>In the 17th century were established the following libraries:
Abbeville, by Charles Sanson in 1685 (46,929 vols., 42 incunabula,
342 MSS.); Besançon by Abbé Boisot in 1696 (93,580 vols., 1000
incunabula, 2247 MSS.). In 1604 the Consistoire réformé de la
Rochelle established a library which possesses to-day 58,900 vols.,
14 incunabula, 1715 MSS. St Étienne, founded by Cardinal de
Villeroi, has 50,000 vols., 8 incunabula, 343 MSS.</p>

<p>The principal libraries founded during the 18th century are the
following: Aix-en-Provence, established by Tournon and Méjane in
1705 (160,000 vols., 300 incunabula, 1351 MSS.); Bordeaux, 1738
(200,000 vols., 3491 MSS.); Chambéry, 1736 (64,200 vols., 47 incunabula,
155 MSS.); Dijon, 1701, founded by P. Fevret (125,000
vols., 211 incunabula, 1669 MSS.); Grenoble, 1772 (260,772 vols.,
635 incunabula, 2485 MSS.); Marseilles, 1799 (111,672 vols., 143
incunabula, 1691 MSS.); Nancy, founded in 1750 by Stanislas
(126,149 vols., 205 incunabula, 1695 MSS.); Nantes, 1753 (103,328
vols., 140 incunabula, 2750 MSS.); Nice, founded in 1786 by Abbé
Massa (55,000 vols., 300 incunabula, 150 MSS.); Nîmes, founded by
J. T. de Séguier in 1778 (80,000 vols., 61 incunabula, 675 MSS.);
Niort, by Jean de Dieu and R. Bion in 1771 (49,413 vols., 67 incunabula,
189 MSS.); Perpignan, by Maréchal de Mailly in 1759 (27,200
vols., 80 incunabula, 127 MSS.); Rennes, 1733 (110,000 vols., 116
incunabula, 602 MSS., income 8950 frs.); Toulouse, by archbishop
of Brienne in 1782 (213,000 vols., 859 incunabula, 1020 MSS.).</p>

<p>Nearly all the other municipal libraries date from the Revolution,
or rather from the period of the redistribution of the books in 1803.
The following municipal libraries possess more than 100,000 vols.:
Avignon (135,000 vols., 698 incunabula, 4152 MSS.), of which the first
collection was the legacy of Calvet in 1810; Caen (122,000 vols., 109
incunabula, 665 MSS.); Montpellier (130,300 vols., 40 incunabula,
251 MSS.); Rouen (140,000 vols., 400 incunabula, 4000 MSS.);
Tours (123,000 vols., 451 incunabula, 1999 MSS.); Versailles (161,000
vols., 436 incunabula, 1213 MSS.).</p>

<p>The following towns have libraries with more than 50,000 volumes:
Amiens, Auxerre, Beaune, Brest, Douai, le Hâvre, Lille, le Mans,
Orléans, Pau, Poitiers, Toulon and Verdun.</p>

<p>The catalogues of the greater part of the municipal libraries are
printed. Especially valuable is the <i>Catalogues des MSS. des bibliothèques
de Paris et des Départements</i>, which began to appear in 1885;
the MSS. of Paris fill 18 octavo volumes, and those of the provinces
50.</p>

<p>The libraries of the provincial universities, thanks to their reorganization
in 1882 and to the care exhibited by the general inspectors,
are greatly augmented. Aix has 74,658 vols.; Alger 160,489;
Besançon 24,275; Bordeaux 216,278; Caen 127,542; Clermont
173,000; Dijon 117,524; Grenoble 127,400; Lille 215,427; Lyons
425,624; Marseilles 53,763; Montpellier 210,938; Nancy 139,036;
Poitiers 180,000; Rennes 166,427; Toulouse 232,000.</p>

<p>Since 1882 the educational libraries have largely developed; in
1877 they were 17,764 in number; in 1907 they were 44,021, containing
7,757,917 vols. The purely scholastic libraries have decreased;
in 1902 there were 2674 libraries with 1,034,132 vols.,
whilst after the reorganization (Circulaire of March 14, 1904) there
were only 1131 with 573,279 vols. The Société Franklin pour la
propagation des bibliothèques populaires et militaires distributed
among the libraries which it controls 55,185 vols., between the years
1900 and 1909.</p>

<p class="pt1 center"><i>Germany</i> (<i>with Austria-Hungary and Switzerland</i>).</p>

<p>Germany is emphatically the home of large libraries; her
former want of political unity and consequent multiplicity of
capitals have had the effect of giving her many large
state libraries, and the number of her universities has
<span class="sidenote">Germany.</span>
tended to multiply considerable collections; 1617 libraries were
registered by P. Schwenke in 1891. As to the conditions, hours
of opening, &amp;c., of 200 of the most important of them, there is
a yearly statement in the <i>Jahrbuch der deutschen Bibliotheken</i>,
published by the Verein deutscher Bibliothekare.</p>

<p>The public libraries of the German empire are of four distinct
types: state libraries, university libraries, town libraries and
popular libraries. The administration and financial affairs of
the state and university libraries are under state control. The
earlier distinction between these two classes has become less and
less marked. Thus the university libraries are no longer restricted
to professors and students, but they are widely used by
scientific workers, and books are borrowed extensively, especially
in Prussia. In Prussia, as a link between the state and the
libraries, there has been since 1907 a special office which deals
with library matters at the Ministry of Public Instruction.
Generally the state does not concern itself with the town
libraries and the popular libraries, but there is much in common
between these two classes. Sometimes popular libraries are under
the supervision of a scientifically administered town library as in
Berlin, Dantzig, &amp;c.; elsewhere, as at Magdeburg, we see an
ancient foundation take up the obligations of a public library.
Only in Prussia and Bavaria are regulations in force as to the
professional education of librarians. Since 1904 the librarians of
the Prussian state libraries have been obliged to complete their
university courses and take up their doctorate, after which they
have to work two years in a library as volunteers and then undergo
a technical examination. The secretarial officials since 1909
have to reach a certain educational standard and must pass an
examination. This regulation has been in force as regards
librarians in Bavaria from 1905.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Berlin is well supplied with libraries, 268 being registered by P.
Schwenke and A. Hortzschansky in 1906, with about 5,000,000
printed vols. The largest of them is the Royal Library,
which was founded by the &ldquo;Great Elector&rdquo; Frederick
<span class="sidenote">Berlin.</span>
William, and opened as a public library in a wing of the electoral
palace in 1661. From 1699 the library became entitled to a copy of
every book published within the royal territories, and it has received
many valuable accessions by purchase and otherwise. It now includes
1,230,000 printed vols. and over 30,000 MSS. The amount
yearly expended upon binding and the acquisition of books, &amp;c., is
£11,326. The catalogues are in manuscript, and include two general
alphabetical catalogues, the one in volumes, the other on slips,
as well as a systematic catalogue in volumes. The following annual
printed catalogues are issued: <i>Verzeichnis der aus der neu erschienenen
Literatur von der K. Bibliothek und den Preussischen Universitats-Bibliotheken
erworbenen Druckschriften</i> (since 1892); <i>Jahresverzeichnis
der an den Deutschen Universitaten erschienenen Schriften</i> (since
1887); <i>Jahresverzeichnis der an den Deutschen Schulanstalten
erschienenen Abhandlungen</i> (since 1889). There is besides a printed
<i>Verzeichnis der im grossen Lesesaal aufgestellten Handbibliothek</i> (4th ed.
1909), the alphabetical <i>Verzeichnis der laufenden Zeitschriften</i> (last
ed., 1908), and the classified <i>Verzeichnis der laufenden Zeitschriften</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page569" id="page569"></a>569</span>
(1908). The catalogue of MSS. are mostly in print, vols. 1-13,
16-23 (1853-1905). The library is specially rich in oriental MSS.,
chiefly due to purchases of private collections. The musical MSS. are
very remarkable and form the richest collection in the world as regards
autographs. The building, erected about 1780 by Frederick
the Great, has long been too small, and a new one was completed in
1909. The building occupies the whole space between the four
streets: Unter den Linden, Dorotheenstrasse, Universitätsstrasse
and Charlottenstrasse, and besides the Royal Library, houses the
University Library and the Academy of Sciences. The conditions
as to the use of the collections are, as in most German libraries, very
liberal. Any adult person is allowed to have books in the reading-room.
Books are lent out to all higher officials, including those
holding educational offices in the university, &amp;c., and by guarantee
to almost any one recommended by persons of standing; borrowing
under pecuniary security is also permitted. By special leave of the
librarian, books and MSS. may be sent to a scholar at a distance, or,
if especially valuable, may be deposited in some public library where
he can conveniently use them. In 1908-1909 264,000 vols. were used
in the reading-rooms, 312,000 were lent inside Berlin, and 32,000
outside. There is a regular system of exchange between the Royal
Library and a great number of Prussian libraries. It is the same in
Bavaria, Württemberg and Baden; the oldest system is that between
Darmstadt and Giessen (dating from 1837). There is either no
charge for carriage to the borrower or the cost is very small. The
reading-room and magazine hall are, with the exception of Sundays
and holidays, open daily from 9 to 9, the borrowing counter from
9 to 6.</p>

<p>Associated with the Royal Library are the following undertakings:
the <i>Gesamtkatalog der Preussischen wissenschaftlichen Bibliotheken</i>
(describing the printed books in the Royal Library and the Prussian
University Libraries in one general catalogue upon slips), the
Auskunftsbureau der Deutschen Bibliotheken (bureau to give
information where any particular book may be consulted), and the
Kommission für den Gesamtkatalog der Wiegendrucke (to draw up a
complete catalogue of books printed before 1500).</p>

<p>The University Library (1831) numbers 220,000 vols. together with
250,000 academical and school dissertations. The number of volumes
lent out in 1908-1909 was 104,000. The library possesses the right
to receive a copy of every work published in the province of Brandenburg.</p>

<p>Some of the governmental libraries are important, especially those
of the Statistisches Landesamt (184,000 vols.); Reichstag (181,000
vols.); Patent-Amt (118,000 vols.); Haus der Abgeordneten (100,000
vols.); Auswärtiges-Amt (118,000 vols.).</p>

<p>The public library of Berlin contains 102,000 vols.; connected
therewith 28 municipal Volksbibliotheken and 14 municipal reading-rooms.
The 28 Volksbibliotheken contain (1908) 194,000 vols.</p>

<p>The Prussian university libraries outside Berlin include Bonn
(332,000 printed vols., 1500 MSS.); Breslau (330,000 printed vols.,
3700 MSS.); Göttingen, from its foundation in 1736/7 the best
administered library of the 18th century (552,000 printed vols., 6800
MSS.); Greifswald (200,000 printed vols., 800 MSS.); Halle
(261,000 printed vols., 2000 MSS.); Kiel (278,000 printed vols.,
2400 MSS.); Königsberg (287,000 printed vols., 1500 MSS.);
Marburg (231,000 printed vols, and about 800 MSS.); Münster
(191,000 printed vols., 800 MSS.). Under provincial administration
are the Königliche and Provinzialbibliothek at Hanover (203,000
printed vols., 4000 MSS.); the Landesbibliothek at Cassel (230,000
printed vols., 4400 MSS.); and the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Bibliothek at
Posen (163,000 printed vols.). A number of the larger towns possess
excellent municipal libraries; Aix-la-Chapelle (112,000 vols.);
Breslau (164,000 vols., 4000 MSS.); Dantzig (145,600 vols., 2900
MSS.); Frankfort a/M (342,000 vols, besides MSS.); Cassel
Murhardsche Bibliothek (141,000 vols., 6300 MSS.); Cologne
(235,000 vols.); Treves (100,000 vols., 2260 MSS.); Wiesbaden
(158,000 vols.).</p>

<p>The libraries of Munich, though not so numerous as those of Berlin,
include two of great importance. The Royal Library, for a long time
the largest collection of books in Germany, was founded
by Duke Albrecht V. of Bavaria (1550-1579), who made
<span class="sidenote">Munich.</span>
numerous purchases from Italy, and incorporated the libraries of the
Nuremberg physician and historian Schedel, of Widmannstadt, and
of J. J. Fugger. The number of printed vols, is estimated at about
1,100,000 and about 50,000 MSS. The library is especially rich in
incunabula, many of them being derived from the libraries of over
150 monasteries closed in 1803. The oriental MSS. are numerous and
valuable, and include the library of Martin Haug. The amount
annually spent upon books and binding is £5000. The catalogues
of the printed books are in manuscript, and include (1) a general
alphabetical catalogue, (2) an alphabetical repertorium of each of the
195 subdivisions of the library, (3) biographical and other subject
catalogues. A printed catalogue of MSS. in 8 vols, was in 1910 nearly
complete; the first was published in 1858. The library is open on
weekdays from 8 to 1 (November to March 8.30 to 1), and on Monday
to Friday (except from August 1 to September 15) also from 3 to 8.
The regulations for the use of the library are very similar to those of
the Royal Library at Berlin. The building was erected for this
collection under King Louis I. in 1832-1843. The archives are
bestowed on the ground floor, and the two upper floors are devoted
to the library, which occupies seventy-seven apartments. The
University Library was originally founded at Ingolstadt in 1472, and
removed with the university to Munich in 1826. At present the
number of vols. amounts to 550,000; the MSS. number 2000.
Forty-six Munich libraries are described in Schwenke&rsquo;s <i>Adressbuch</i>,
15 of which possessed in 1909 about 2,000,000 printed vols. and
about 60,000 MSS. After the two mentioned above the most noteworthy
is the Königlich Bayrische Armee-Bibliothek (100,000
printed vols., 1000 MSS.).</p>

<p>The chief Bavarian libraries outside Munich are the Royal Library
at Bamberg (350,000 vols., 4300 MSS.) and the University Library at
Würzburg (390,000 vols., 1500 MSS.); both include rich monastic
libraries. The University Library at Erlangen has 237,000 vols.
The Staats-Kreis and Stadtbibliothek at Augsburg owns 200,000
vols., and 2000 MSS.; Nuremberg has two great collections, the
Bibliothek des Germanischen National-museums (250,000 vols.,
3550 MSS.) and the Stadtbibliothek (104,000 vols., 2500 MSS.).</p>

<p>In 1906 there were in Dresden 78 public libraries with about
1,495,000 vols. The Royal Public Library in the Japanese Palace
was founded in the 16th century. Among its numerous
acquisitions have been the library of Count Bünau in
<span class="sidenote">Dresden.</span>
1764, and the MSS. of Ebert. Special attention is devoted to history
and literature. The library possesses more than 520,000 vols. (1909);
the MSS. number 6000. Admission to the reading-room is granted to
any respectable adult on giving his name, and books are lent out to
persons qualified by their position or by a suitable guarantee. Here,
as at other large libraries in Germany, works of belles-lettres are only
supplied for a literary purpose. The number of persons using the
reading-room in a year is about 14,000, and about 23,000 vols. are
lent. The second largest library in Dresden, the Bibliothek des
Statistischen Landes-Amtes, has 120,000 vols.</p>

<p>Leipzig is well equipped with libraries; that of the University has
550,000 vols. and 6500 MSS. The Bibliothek des Reichsgerichts has
151,000 vols., the Pädagogische Central-Bibliothek der Comenius-Stiftung
150,000 vols., and the Stadtbibliothek 125,000 vols., with
1500 MSS.</p>

<p>The Royal Public Library of Stuttgart, although only established
in 1765, has grown so rapidly that it now possesses about 374,000
vols. of printed works and 5300 MSS. There is a famous
collection of Bibles, containing over 7200 vols. The
<span class="sidenote">Stuttgart.</span>
annual expenditure devoted to books and binding is £2475. The
library also enjoys the copy-privilege in Württemberg. The annual
number of borrowers is over 2600, who use nearly 29,000 vols. The
number issued in the reading-room is 41,000. The number of parcels
despatched from Stuttgart is nearly 23,000. Admission is also gladly
granted to the Royal Private Library, founded in 1810, which contains
about 137,000 vols.</p>

<p>Of the other libraries of Württemberg the University Library of
Tübingen (500,000 vols. and 4100 MSS.) need only be noted.</p>

<p>The Grand-ducal Library of Darmstadt was established by the
grand-duke Louis I. in 1819, on the basis of the still older
<span class="sidenote">Darmstadt.</span>
library formed in the 17th century, and includes 510,000
vols. and about 3600 MSS. (1909). The number of vols. used
in the course of the year is about 90,000, of which 14,000 are lent out.</p>

<p>Among the other libraries of the Grand Duchy of Hesse the most
remarkable are the University Library at Giessen (230,000 vols.,
1500 MSS.), and the Stadtbibliothek at Mainz (220,000 vols., 1200
MSS.) to which is attached the Gutenberg Museum.</p>

<p>In the Grand Duchy of Baden are the Hof- und Landesbibliothek
at Carlsruhe (202,000 vols., 3800 MSS.), the University Library at
Freiburg i/B (300,000 vols., 700 MSS.), and the University Library
at Heidelberg. This, the oldest of the German University libraries,
was founded in 1386. In 1623 the whole collection, described by
Joseph Scaliger in 1608 as &ldquo;locupletior et meliorum librorum quam
Vaticana,&rdquo; was carried as a gift to the pope and only the German
MSS. were afterwards returned. The library was re-established in
1703, and after 1800 enriched with monastic spoils; it now contains
about 400,000 vols. and 3500 MSS. for the most part of great value.</p>

<p>Among the State or University libraries of other German states
should be mentioned Detmold (110,000 vols.); Jena (264,000 vols.);
Neustrelitz (130,000 vols.); Oldenburg (126,000 vols.); Rostock
(275,000 vols.); Schwerin (225,000 vols.); and Weimar (270,000),
all possessing rich collections of MSS.</p>

<p>The Ducal Library of Gotha was established by Duke Ernest the
Pious in the 17th century, and contains many valuable books and
MSS. from monastic collections. It numbers about
<span class="sidenote">Gotha.</span>
192,000 vols., with 7400 MSS. The catalogue of the
oriental MSS., chiefly collected by Seetzen, and forming one-half of
the collection, is one of the best in existence.</p>

<p>The Ducal Library at Wolfenbüttel, founded in the second half
of the 16th century by Duke Julius, was made over to the university
of Helmstedt in 1614, whence the most important treasures were
returned to Wolfenbüttel in the 19th century; it now numbers
300,000 vols., 7400 MSS.</p>

<p>The chief libraries of the Hanse towns are: Bremen (Stadtbibliothek,
141,000 vols.), and Lübeck (Stadtbibliothek, 121,000
vols.); the most important being the Stadtbibliothek at Hamburg,
made public since 1648 (383,000 vols., 7300 MSS., among them many
Mexican). Hamburg has also in the Kommerzbibliothek (120,000
vols.) a valuable trade collection, and the largest Volksbibliothek
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page570" id="page570"></a>570</span>
(about 100,000 vols.) after that at Berlin. Alsace-Lorraine has the
most recently formed of the great German collections&mdash;the Universitäts-
und Landesbibliothek at Strassburg, which, though
founded only in 1871 to replace that which had been destroyed in the
siege, already ranks amongst the largest libraries of the empire.
Its books amount to 922,000 vols., the number of MSS. is 5900.</p>
</div>

<p>The <i>Adressbuch der Bibliotheken der Oesterreich-ungarischen
Monarchie</i> by Bohatta and Holzmann (1900) describes 1014
libraries in Austria, 656 in Hungary, and 23 in Bosnia
<span class="sidenote">Austria.</span>
and Herzegovina. Included in this list, however, are
private lending libraries.</p>

<p>The largest library in Austria, and one of the most important
collections in Europe, is the Imperial Public Library at Vienna,
apparently founded by the emperor Frederick III. in 1440,
although its illustrious librarian Lambecius, in the well-known
inscription over the entrance to the library which summarizes
its history attributes this honour to Frederick&rsquo;s son Maximilian.
However this may be, the munificence of succeeding emperors
greatly added to the wealth of the collection, including a not
inconsiderable portion of the dispersed library of Corvinus.
Since 1808 the library has also been entitled to the copy-privilege
in respect of all books published in the empire. The sum
devoted to the purchase and binding of books is £6068 annually.
The number of printed vols. is 1,000,000; 8000 incunabula.
The MSS. amount to 27,000, with 100,000 papyri of the collection
of Archduke Rainer. The main library apartment is one of the
most splendid halls in Europe. Admission to the reading-room
is free to everybody, and books are also lent out under stricter
limitations. The University Library of Vienna was established
by Maria Theresa. The reading-room is open to all comers,
and the library is open from 1st Oct. to 30th June from 9 a.m.
to 8 p.m.; in the other months for shorter hours. In 1909
447,391 vols. were used in the library, 45,000 vols. lent out in
Vienna, and 6519 vols. sent carriage free to borrowers outside
Vienna. The number of printed vols. is 757,000. For the purchase
of books and binding the Vienna University Library has
annually 60,000 crowns from the state as well as 44,000 crowns
from matriculation fees and contributions from the students.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The total number of libraries in Vienna enumerated by Bohatta
and Holzmann is 165, and many of them are of considerable extent.
One of the oldest and most important libraries of the monarchy is the
University Library at Cracow, with 380,000 vols. and 8169 MSS.</p>

<p>The number of monastic libraries in Austria is very considerable.
They possess altogether more than 2,500,000 printed vols., 25,000
incunabula and 25,000 MSS. The oldest of them, and the oldest in
Austria, is that of the monastery of St Peter at Salzburg, which was
established by Archbishop Arno (785-821). It includes 70,000 vols.,
nearly 1500 incunabula. The three next in point of antiquity are
Kremsmünster (100,000), Admont (86,000) and Melk (70,000), all of
them dating from the 11th century. Many of the librarians of
these monastic libraries are trained in the great Vienna libraries.
There is no official training as in Prussia and Bavaria.</p>
</div>

<p>Information about income, administration, accessions, &amp;c., of
the chief libraries in the Hungarian kingdom, are given in the
Hungarian <i>Statistical Year Book</i> annually. The largest
library in Hungary is the Széchenyi-Nationalbibliothek
<span class="sidenote">Hungary.</span>
at Budapest, founded in 1802 by the gift of the library of Count
Franz Széchenyi. It contains 400,000 printed vols., 16,000 MSS.,
and has a remarkable collection of Hungarica. The University
Library of Budapest includes 273,000 printed books and more
than 2000 MSS. Since 1897 there has been in Hungary a Chief
Inspector of Museums and Libraries whose duty is to watch
all public museums and libraries which are administered by
committees, municipalities, religious bodies and societies. He
also has undertaken the task of organizing a general catalogue
of all the MSS. and early printed books in Hungary.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The libraries of the monasteries and other institutions of the
Catholic Church are many in number but not so numerous as in
Austria. The chief among them, the library of the Benedictines at
St Martinsberg, is the central library of the order in Hungary and
contains nearly 170,000 vols. It was reconstituted in 1802 after the
re-establishment of the order. The principal treasures of this abbey
(11th century) were, on the secularization of the monasteries under
Joseph II., distributed among the state libraries in Budapest.</p>
</div>

<p>Among the Swiss libraries, which numbered 2096 in 1868,
there is none of the first rank. Only three possess over 200,000
vols.&mdash;the University Library at Basle founded in 1460, the
Cantonal Library at Lausanne, and the Stadtbibliothek at
<span class="sidenote">Switzerland.</span>
Berne, which since 1905 is united to the University
Library of that city. One great advantage of the
Swiss libraries is that they nearly all possess printed
catalogues, which greatly further the plan of compiling a great
general catalogue of all the libraries of the republic. A valuable
co-operative work is their treatment of Helvetiana. All the
literature since 1848 is collected by the Landes-Bibliothek at
Berne, established in 1895 for this special object. The older
literature is brought together in the Bürgerbibliothek at Lucerne,
for which it has a government grant. The monastic libraries
of St Gall and Einsiedeln date respectively from the years 830
and 946, and are of great historical and literary interest.</p>

<p class="pt1 center"><i>Italy.</i></p>

<p>As the former centre of civilization, Italy is, of course, the
country in which the oldest existing libraries must be looked for,
and in which the rarest and most valuable MSS. are preserved.
The Vatican at Rome and the Laurentian Library at Florence
are sufficient in themselves to entitle Italy to rank before most
other states in that respect, and the venerable relics at Vercelli,
Monte Cassino and La Cava bear witness to the enlightenment
of the peninsula while other nations were slowly taking their
places in the circle of Christian polity. The local rights and
interests which so long helped to impede the unification of Italy
were useful in creating and preserving at numerous minor
centres many libraries which otherwise would probably have
been lost during the progress of absorption that results from such
centralization as exists in England. In spite of long centuries
of suffering and of the aggression of foreign swords and foreign
gold, Italy is still rich in books and MSS. The latest official
statistics (1896) give particulars of 1831 libraries, of which
419 are provincial and communal. In 1893 there were 542
libraries of a popular character and including circulating libraries.</p>

<p>The governmental libraries (<i>biblioteche governative</i>) number 36
and are under the authority of the minister of public instruction.
The <i>Regolamento</i> controlling them was issued in the <i>Bolletino
Ufficiale</i>, 5 Dec. 1907. They consist of the national
<span class="sidenote">Governmental libraries.</span>
central libraries of Rome (Vittorio Emanuele) and
Florence, of the national libraries of Milan (Braidense),
Naples, Palermo, Turin and Venice (Marciana); the Biblioteca
governativa at Cremona; the Marucelliana, the Mediceo-Laurenziana
and the Riccardiana at Florence; the governativa at
Lucca; the Estense at Modena; the Brancacciana and that of
San Giacomo at Naples; the Palatina at Parma; the Angelica,
the Casanatense, and the Lancisiana at Rome; the university
libraries of Bologna, Cagliari, Catania, Genoa, Messina, Modena,
Naples, Padua, Pavia, Pisa, Rome and Sassari; the Ventimiliana
at Catania (joined to the university library for administrative
purposes); the Vallicelliana and the musical library of the R.
Accad. of St Cecilia at Rome; the musical section of the Palatine
at Parma; and the Lucchesi-Palli (added to the national library
at Naples). There are provisions whereby small collections can
be united to larger libraries in the same place and where there
are several government libraries in one city a kind of corporate
administration can be arranged. The libraries belonging to
bodies concerned with higher education, to the royal scientific
and literary academies, fine art galleries, museums and scholastic
institutions are ruled by special regulations. The minister of
public instruction is assisted by a technical board.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page571" id="page571"></a>571</span></p>

<p>The librarians and subordinates are divided into (1) librarians,
or keepers of MSS.; (2) sub-librarians, or sub-keepers of MSS.;
(3) attendants, or book distributors; (4) ushers, &amp;c. Those of
class 1 constitute the &ldquo;board of direction,&rdquo; which is presided
over by the librarian, and meets from time to time to consider
important measures connected with the administration of the
library. Each library is to possess, alike for books and MSS.,
a general inventory, an accessions register, an alphabetical
author-catalogue and a subject-catalogue. When they are
ready, catalogues of the special collections are to be compiled,
and these the government intends to print. A general catalogue
of the MSS. was in 1910 being issued together with catalogues of
oriental codices and incunabula. Various other small registers
are provided for. The sums granted by the state for library
purposes must be applied to (1) salaries and the catalogues of the
MSS.; (2) maintenance and other expenses; (3) purchase of
books, binding and repairs, &amp;c. Books are chosen by the
librarians. In the university libraries part of the expenditure
is decided by the librarians, and part by a council formed by the
professors of the different faculties. The rules (<i>Boll. Ufficiale</i>,
Sept. 17, 1908) for lending books and MSS. allow them to be
sent to other countries under special circumstances.</p>

<p>The 36 <i>biblioteche governative</i> annually spend about 300,000
lire in books. From the three sources of gifts, copyright and
purchases, their accessions in 1908 were 142,930, being 21,122
more than the previous year. The number of readers is increasing.
In 1908 there were 1,176,934, who made use of
1,650,542 vols., showing an increase of 30,456 readers and
67,579 books as contrasted with the statistics of the previous
year. Two monthly publications catalogue the accessions of
these libraries, one dealing with copyright additions of Italian
literature, the other with all foreign books.</p>

<p>The minister of public instruction has kept a watchful eye upon
the literary treasures of the suppressed monastic bodies. In
1875 there were 1700 of these confiscated libraries, containing
two millions and a half of volumes. About 650 of the collections
were added to the contents of the public libraries already in
existence; the remaining 1050 were handed over to the different
local authorities, and served to form 371 new communal libraries,
and in 1876 the number of new libraries so composed was 415.</p>

<p>The Biblioteca Vaticana stands in the very first rank among
European libraries as regards antiquity and wealth of MSS.
We can trace back the history of the Biblioteca
Vaticana to the earliest records of the <i>Scrinium
Sedis Apostolicae</i>,
<span class="sidenote">Vatican.</span>
which was enshrined in safe custody at the
Lateran, and later on partly in the Turris Chartularia; but of
all the things that used to be stored there, the only survival,
and that is a dubious example, is the celebrated Codex Amiatinus
now in the Laurentian Library at Florence. Of the new period
inaugurated by Innocent III. there but remains to us the
inventory made under Boniface VIII. The library shared in
the removal of the Papal court to Avignon, where the collection
was renewed and increased, but the Pontifical Library at Avignon
has only in part, and in later times, been taken into the Library
of the Vatican. This latter is a new creation of the great
humanist popes of the 15th century. Eugenius IV. planted the
first seed, but Nicholas V. must be looked upon as the real
founder of the library, to which Sixtus IV. consecrated a definite
abode, ornate and splendid, in the Court of the Pappagallo.
Sixtus V. erected the present magnificent building in 1588, and
greatly augmented the collection. The library increased under
various popes and librarians, among the most noteworthy of
whom were Marcello Cervini, the first <i>Cardinale Bibliotecario</i>, later
Pone Marcel II., Sirleto and A. Carafa. In 1600 it was further
enriched by the acquisition of the valuable library of Fulvio
Orsini, which contained the pick of the most precious libraries.
Pope Paul V. (1605-1621) separated the library from the
archives, fixed the progressive numeration of the Greek and
Latin MSS., and added two great halls, called the Pauline, for
the new codices. Under him and under Urban VIII. a number
of MSS. were purchased from the Convento of Assisi, of the
Minerva at Rome, of the Capranica College, &amp;c. Especially
noteworthy are the ancient and beautiful MSS. of the
monastery of Bobbio, and those which were acquired in various
ways from the monastery of Rossano. Gregory XV. (1622)
received from Maximilian I., duke of Bavaria, by way of compensation
for the money supplied by him for the war, the valuable
library of the Elector Palatine, which was seized by Count Tilly
at the capture of Heidelberg. Alexander VII. (1658), having
purchased the large and beautiful collection formerly belonging
to the dukes of Urbino, added the MSS. of it to the Vatican
library. The <i>Libreria della Regina</i>, <i>i.e.</i> of Christina, queen of
Sweden, composed of very precious manuscripts from ancient
French monasteries, from St Gall in Switzerland, and others&mdash;also
of the MSS. of Alexandre Petau, of great importance for
their history and French literature, was purchased and in great
part presented to the Vatican library by Pope Alexander VIII.
(Ottoboni) in 1689, while other MSS. came in later with the
Ottoboni library. Under Clement XI. there was the noteworthy
purchase of the 54 Greek MSS. which had belonged to Pius II.,
and also the increase of the collection of Oriental MSS. Under
Benedict XIV. there came into the Vatican library, as a legacy,
the library of the Marchese Capponi, very rich in rare and
valuable Italian editions, besides 285 MSS.; and by a purchase,
the Biblioteca Ottoboniana, which, from its wealth in Greek,
Latin, and even Hebrew MSS., was, after that of the
Vatican, the richest in all Rome. Clement XIII. in 1758,
Clement XIV. in 1769, and Pius VI. in 1775 were also benefactors.
During three centuries the vast and monumental
library grew with uninterrupted prosperity, but it was to undergo
a severe blow at the end of the 18th century. In 1798, as a
sequel to the Treaty of Tolentino, 500 MSS. picked from the
most valuable of the different collections were sent to Paris
by the victorious French to enrich the Bibliothèque Nationale
and other libraries. These, however, were chiefly restored in
1815. Most of the Palatine MSS., which formed part of the
plunder, found their way back to the university of Heidelberg.
Pius VII. acquired for the Vatican the library of Cardinal Zelada
in 1800, and among other purchases of the 19th century must
be especially noted the splendid Cicognara collection of archaeology
and art (1823); as well as the library in 40,000 vols. of
Cardinal Angelo Mai (1856). Recent more important purchases,
during the Pontificate of Leo XIII., have been the Borghese
MSS., about 300 in number, representing part of the ancient
library of the popes at Avignon; the entire precious library of
the Barberini; the Borgia collection <i>De Propaganda Fide</i>,
containing Latin and Oriental MSS., and 500 incunabula.</p>

<p>Few libraries are so magnificently housed as the Biblioteca
Vaticana. The famous <i>Codici Vaticani</i> are placed in the <i>salone</i>
or great double hall, which is decorated with frescoes depicting
ancient libraries and councils of the church. At the end of the
great hall an immense gallery, also richly decorated, and extending
to 1200 ft., opens out from right to left. Here are
preserved in different rooms the codici Palatini, Regin., Ottoboniani,
Capponiani, &amp;c. The printed books only are on open
shelves, the MSS. being preserved in closed cases. The printed
books that were at first stored in the Borgia Apartment, now
with the library of Cardinal Mai, constitute in great part the
<i>Nuova Sala di Consultazione</i>, which was opened to students under
the Pontificate of Leo XIII. Other books, on the other hand,
are still divided into 1<span class="sp">a</span> and 2<span class="sp">da</span> raccolta, according to the ancient
denomination, and are stored in adjacent halls.</p>

<p>Well-reasoned calculations place the total number of printed
books at 400,000 vols.; of incunabula about 4000, with many
vellum copies; 500 Aldines and a great number of bibliographical
rarities. The Latin manuscripts number 31,373; the Greek
amount to 4148; the Oriental MSS., of which the computation
is not complete, amount to about 4000. Among the Greek and
Latin MSS. are some of the most valuable in the world, alike for
antiquity and intrinsic importance. It is sufficient to mention
the famous biblical <i>Codex Vaticanus</i> of the 4th century, the two
Virgils of the 4th and 5th centuries, the Bembo Terence, the
palimpsest <i>De Republica</i> of Cicero, conjectured to be of the 4th
century, discovered by Cardinal Mai, and an extraordinary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page572" id="page572"></a>572</span>
number of richly ornamented codices of great beauty and costliness.
The archives are apart from the library, and are accessible
in part to the public under conditions. Leo XIII. appointed
a committee to consider what documents of general interest
might expediently be published.</p>

<p>The Biblioteca Vaticana is now open from October 1st to Easter
every morning between 9 and 1 o&rsquo;clock, and from Easter to
June 29 from 8 o&rsquo;clock to 12, with the exception of Sundays,
Thursdays and the principal feast days.</p>

<p>Catalogues of special classes of MSS. have been published.
The Oriental MSS. have been described by J. S. Assemani, <i>Bibliotheca
orientalis Clementino-Vaticana</i> (Rome, 1719-1728, 4 vols.
folio), and <i>Bibl. Vat. codd. MSS. catalogus ab S. E. et J. S.
Assentano redactus</i> (ib., 1756-1759, 3 vols. folio), and by Cardinal
Mai in <i>Script. Vet. nova collectio</i>. The Coptic MSS. have been
specially treated by G. Zoega (Rome, 1810, folio) and by F. G.
Bonjour (Rome, 1699, 4to). There are printed catalogues of the
Capponi (1747) and the Cicognara (1820) libraries. The following
catalogues have lately been printed: E. Stevenson, <i>Codd.
Palatini Graeci</i> (1885), <i>Codd. Gr. Reg. Sueciae et Pii II.</i> (1888);
Feron-Battaglini, <i>Codd. Ottobon. Graeci</i> (1893); C. Stornaiolo,
<i>Codd. Urbinates Gr.</i> (1895); E. Stevenson, <i>Codd. Palatini Lat.</i>
tom. 1 (1886); G. Salvo-Cozzo, <i>Codici Capponiani</i> (1897);
M. Vattasso and P. Franchi de&rsquo; Cavalieri, <i>Codd. Lat. Vaticani</i>,
tom. 1 (1902); C. Stornaiolo, <i>Codices Urbinates Latini</i>, tom. 1
(1902); E. Stevenson, <i>Inventario dei libri stampali Palatino-Vaticani</i>
(1886-1891); and several volumes relating to Egyptian
papyri by O. Marucchi. Some of the greatest treasures have
been reproduced in facsimile.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The most important library in Italy for modern requirements is
the Nazionale Centrale Vittorio Emanuele. From its foundation in
1875, incorporating the <i>biblioteca maior o secreta</i> of the
Jesuits in the Collegio Romano, and all the cloister
<span class="sidenote">Other Roman libraries.</span>
libraries of the Provincia Romana which had devolved to
the state through the suppression of the Religious Orders,
it has now, by purchases, by donations, through the operation of the
law of the press increased to about 850,000 printed vols., and is
continually being ameliorated. It possesses about 1600 incunabula
and 6200 MSS. Noteworthy among these are the Farfensi and the
Sessoriani MSS. of Santa Croce in Jerusalem, and some of these last
of the 6th to the 8th centuries are real treasures. The library has
been recently reorganized. It is rich in the history of the renaissance,
Italian and foreign reviews, and Roman topography. A monthly
<i>Bollettino</i> is issued of modern foreign literature received by the
libraries of Italy.</p>

<p>The Biblioteca Casanatense, founded by Cardinal Casanate in
1698, contains about 200,000 printed vols., over 2000 incunabula,
with many Roman and Venetian editions, and more than 5000 MSS.,
among which are examples of the 8th, 9th and 10th centuries. They
are arranged in eleven large rooms, the large central hall being one
of the finest in Rome. It is rich in theology, the history of the
middle ages, jurisprudence and the economic, social and political
sciences. An incomplete catalogue of the printed books by A.
Audiffredi still remains a model of its kind (Roma, 1761-1788,
4 vols. folio, and part of vol. v.).</p>

<p>The Biblioteca Angelica was founded in 1605 by Monsignor Angelo
Rocca, an Augustinian, and was the first library in Rome to throw
open its doors to the public. It contains about 90,000 vols., of which
about 1000 are incunabula; 2570 MSS., of which 120 are Greek,
and 91 Oriental. It includes all the authentic acts of the Congregatio
de Auxiliis and the collections of Cardinal Passionei and Lucas
Holstenius.</p>

<p>The Biblioteca Universitaria Alessandrina was founded by Pope
Alexander VII., with the greater part of the printed books belonging
to the dukes of Urbino, and was opened in 1676. In 1815 Pius VII.
granted to it the right to receive a copy of every printed book in the
States of the Church, which grant at the present time, by virtue of
the laws of Italy, is continued, but limited to the province of Rome.
The library possesses 130,000 printed books, 600 incunabula, 376 MSS.</p>

<p>The library of the Senate was established at Turin in 1848. It
contains nearly 87,000 vols. and is rich in municipal history and the
statutes of Italian cities, the last collection extending to 2639 statutes
or vols. for 679 municipalities. The library of the Chamber of
Deputies contains 120,000 vols. and pamphlets. It is rich in modern
works, and especially in jurisprudence, native and foreign history,
economics and administration.</p>

<p>The Biblioteca Vallicelliana was founded by Achille Stazio (1581),
and contains some valuable manuscripts, including a Latin Bible of
the 8th century attributed to Alcuin, and some inedited writings of
Baronius. It now contains 28,000 vols. and 2315 MSS. Since 1884 it
has been in the custody of the R. Società Romana di Storia Patria.
The Biblioteca Lancisiana, founded in 1711 by G. M. Lancisi, is
valuable for its medical collections.</p>

<p>In 1877 Professor A. Sarti presented to the city of Rome his
collection of fine-art books, 10,000 vols., which was placed in charge
of the Accademia di San Luca, which already possessed a good
artistic library. The Biblioteca Centrale Militare (1893) includes
66,000 printed vols. and 72,000 maps and plans relating to military
affairs; and the Biblioteca della R. Accad. di S. Cecilia (1875), a
valuable musical collection of 40,000 volumes and 2300 MSS.</p>

<p>Among the private libraries accessible by permission, the Chigiana
(1660) contains 25,000 vols. and 2877 MSS. The Corsiniana, founded
by Clement XII. (Lorenzo Corsini) is rich in incunabula, and includes
one of the most remarkable collections of prints, the series of Marc-Antonios
being especially complete. It was added to the Accademia
dei Lincei in 1884 and now extends to 43,000 vols. The library of
the Collegium de Propaganda Fide was established by Urban VIII.
in 1626. It owes its present richness almost entirely to testamentary
gifts, among which may be mentioned those of Cardinals Borgia,
Caleppi and Di Pietro. It is a private collection for the use of the
congregation and of those who belong to it, but permission may be
obtained from the superiors. There are at least thirty libraries in
<span class="sidenote">Subiaco.</span>
Rome which are more or less accessible to the public. At
Subiaco, about 40 m. from Rome, the library of the Benedictine
monastery of Santa Scolastica is not a very large one, comprising
only 6000 printed vols. and 400 MSS., but the place is remarkable
as having been the first seat of typography in Italy. It
was in this celebrated Protocoenobium that Schweynheim and
Pannartz, fresh from the dispersion of Fust and Schoeffer&rsquo;s workmen
in 1462, established their press and produced a series of very rare
and important works which are highly prized throughout Europe.
The Subiaco library, although open daily to readers, is only visited
by students who are curious to behold the cradle of the press in Italy,
and to inspect the series of original editions preserved in their
first home.</p>

<p>The Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale of Florence, formed from the
union of Magliabechi&rsquo;s library with the Palatina, is the largest after
the Vittorio Emanuele at Rome. The Magliabechi collection
became public property in 1714, and with accessions
<span class="sidenote">Florence.</span>
from time to time, held an independent place until 1862, when the
Palatina (formed by Ferdinand III., Grand Duke of Tuscany), was
incorporated with it. An old statute by which a copy of every work
printed in Tuscany was to be presented to the Magliabechi library
was formerly much neglected, but has been maintained more
rigorously in force since 1860. Since 1870 it receives by law a copy of
every book published in the kingdom. A <i>Bollettino</i> is issued describing
these accessions. There are many valuable autograph originals
of famous works in this library, and the MSS. include the most important
extant <i>codici</i> of Dante and later poets, as well as of the
historians from Villani to Machiavelli and Guicciardini. Amongst
the printed books is a very large assemblage of rare early impressions,
a great number of the <i>Rappresentazioni</i> of the 16th century, at least
200 books printed on vellum, and a copious collection of municipal
histories and statutes, of <i>testi di lingua</i> and of maps. The Galileo
collection numbers 308 MSS. The MS. portolani, 25 in number, are
for the most part of great importance; the oldest is dated 1417, and
several seem to be the original charts executed for Sir Robert Dudley
(duke of Northumberland) in the preparation of his <i>Arcano del Mare</i>.
The library contains (1909) 571,698 printed vols., 20,222 MSS., 9037
engravings, 21,000 portraits, 3847 maps, and 3575 incunabula. In
1902 the Italian parliament voted the funds for a new building which
is being erected on the Corso dei Tintori close to the Santa Croce
Church.</p>

<p>The Biblioteca Nazionale of Milan, better known as the Braidense,
founded in 1770 by Maria Theresa, consists of 243,000 printed vols.
1787 MSS. and over 3000 autographs. It comprises nearly
2300 books printed in the 15th century (including the
<span class="sidenote">Milan.</span>
rare <i>Monte Santo di Dio</i> of Bettini, 1477), 913 Aldine impressions,
and a xylographic <i>Biblia Pauperum</i>. Amongst the MSS. are an
early Dante and autograph letters of Galileo, some poems in Tasso&rsquo;s
autograph, and a fine series of illustrated service-books, with miniatures
representing the advance of Italian art from the 12th to the
16th century. One room is devoted to the works of Manzoni.</p>

<p>The Biblioteca Nazionale at Naples, though only opened to the
public in 1804, is the largest library of that city. The nucleus from
which it developed was the collection of Cardinal Seripando,
which comprised many MSS. and printed books of
<span class="sidenote">Naples.</span>
great value. Acquisitions came in from other sources, especially
when in the year 1848 many private and conventual libraries were
thrown on the Neapolitan market, and still more so in 1860. The
Biblical section is rich in rarities, commencing with the Mainz Bible
of 1462, printed on vellum. Other special features are the collection
of <i>testi di lingua</i>, that of books on volcanoes, the best collection in
existence of the publications of Italian literary and scientific societies
and a nearly complete set of the works issued by the Bodoni press.
The MSS. include a palimpsest containing writings of the 3rd, 5th
and 6th centuries under a grammatical treatise of the 8th, 2 Latin
papyri of the 6th century, over 50 Latin Bibles, many illuminated
books with miniatures, and the autographs of G. Leopardi. There
are more than 40 books printed on vellum in the 15th and 16th
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page573" id="page573"></a>573</span>
centuries, including a fine first Homer; and several MS. maps and
portolani, one dating from the end of the 14th century. The library
contains about 389,100 printed vols., 7990 MSS. and 4217 incunabula.</p>

<p>The Biblioteca Nazionale of Palermo, founded from the Collegio
Massimo of the Jesuits, with additions from other libraries of that
suppressed order, is rich in 15th-century books, which
<span class="sidenote">Palermo.</span>
have been elaborately described in a catalogue printed in
1875, and in Aldines and bibliographical curiosities of the 16th and
following centuries, and a very complete series of the Sicilian publications
of the 16th century, many being unique. The library contains
167,898 printed vols., 2550 incunabula, 1537 MSS.</p>

<p>The Biblioteca Nazionale Universitatia of Turin took its origin in
the donation of the private library of the House of Savoy, which in
1720 was made to the University by Vittorio Amedeo II.
The disastrous fire of January 1904 destroyed about 24,000
<span class="sidenote">Turin.</span>
out of the 300,000 vols. which the library possessed, and of the MSS.,
the number of which was 4138, there survive now but 1500 in a
more or less deteriorated condition. Among those that perished
were the palimpsests of Cicero, Cassidorus, the Codex Theodosianus
and the famous <i>Livre d&rsquo;Heures</i>. What escaped the fire entirely was
the valuable collection of 1095 incunabula, the most ancient of which
is the <i>Rationale Divinorum Officiorum</i> of 1459. Since the fire the
library has been enriched by new gifts, the most conspicuous of
which is the collection of 30,000 vols. presented by Baron Alberto
Lumbroso, principally relating to the French Revolution and
empire. The library was in 1910 about to be transferred to the
premises of the Palazzo of the Debito Publico. The Biblioteca
Marciana, or library of St Mark at Venice, was traditionally founded
<span class="sidenote">Venice.</span>
in 1362 by a donation of MSS. from the famous Petrarch
(all of them now lost) and instituted as a library by
Cardinal Bessarione in 1468. The printed vols. number 417,314.
The precious contents include 12,106 MSS. of great value, of which
more than 1000 Greek codices were given by Cardinal Bessarione,
important MS. collections of works on Venetian history, music and
theatre, rare incunabula, and a great number of volumes, unique or
exceedingly rare, on the subject of early geographical research.
Amongst the MSS. is a Latin Homer, an invaluable codex of the laws
of the Lombards, and the autograph MS. of Sarpi&rsquo;s <i>History of the
Council of Trent</i>. Since the fall of the republic and the suppression
of the monasteries a great many private and conventual libraries
have been incorporated with the Marciana, which had its first abode
in the Libreria del Sansovino, from which in turn it was transferred
in 1812 to the Palazzo Ducale, and from this again in 1904 to the
Palazzo della Zecca (The Mint).</p>

<p>Among the university libraries under government control some
deserve special notice. First in historical importance comes the
Biblioteca della Università at Bologna, founded by the
naturalist U. Aldrovandi, who bequeathed by his will in
<span class="sidenote">University libraries.</span>
1605 to the senate of Bologna his collection of 3800
printed books and 360 MSS. Count Luigi F. Marsili increased
the library by a splendid gift in 1712 and established an Istituto
delle Scienze, reconstituted as a public library by Benedict
XIV. in 1756. The printed books number 255,000 vols., and the
MSS. 5000. The last comprise a rich Oriental collection of 547 MSS.
in Arabic, 173 in Turkish, and several in Persian, Armenian and
Hebrew. Amongst the Latin codices is a Lactantius of the 6th or
7th century. The other noteworthy articles include a copy of the
Armenian gospels (12th century), the Avicenna, with miniatures
dated 1194, described in Montfaucon&rsquo;s <i>Diarium Italicum</i>, and some
unpublished Greek texts. Amongst the Italian MSS. is a rich assemblage
of municipal histories. Mezzofanti was for a long time the
custodian here, and his own collection of books has been incorporated
in the library, which is remarkable likewise for the number of early
editions and Aldines which it contains. A collection of drawings by
Agostino Caracci is another special feature of worth. The grand
hall with its fine furniture in walnut wood merits particular attention.
The Biblioteca della Università at Naples was established by Joachim
Murat in 1812 in the buildings of Monte Oliveto, and has thence been
sometimes called the &ldquo;Biblioteca Gioacchino.&rdquo; Later it was transferred
to the Royal University of studies, and was opened to the
public in 1827. It was increased by the libraries of several monastic
bodies. The most copious collections relate to the study of medicine
and natural science. It possesses about 300,000 printed books, 404
incunabula, 203 Aldines, and 196 Bodoni editions, but the more
important incunabula and MSS. about the middle of the 19th
century went to enrich the Biblioteca Nazionale. Other important
university libraries are those of Catania (1755), 130,000 vols.; Genoa
(1773), 132,000 vols., 1588 MSS.; Pavia (1763), 250,000 vols.,
1100 MSS.; Padua (200,000 vols., 2356 MSS.), which in 1910 was
housed in a new building; Cagliari (90,000 vols.); Sassari (74,000
vols.). Messina, destroyed in the earthquake of 1908, preserved,
however, beneath its ruins the more important part of its furniture
and fittings, and in 1910 was already restored to active work, as
regards the portion serving for the reawakened Faculty of Law in
the University.</p>

<p>Chief among the remaining government libraries comes the world-famed
Biblioteca Mediceo-Laurenziana at Florence, formed from the
collections of Cosimo the Elder, Pietro de&rsquo; Medici, and Lorenzo the
Magnificent (which, however, passed away from the family after
<span class="sidenote">Mediceo-Laurenziana.</span>
the expulsion of the Medici from Florence, and were repurchased
in 1508 by Cardinal Giovanni, afterwards Leo X.). It was first
constituted as a public library in Florence by Clement
VII., who charged Michelangelo to construct a suitable
edifice for its reception. It was opened to the public by
Cosimo I. in 1571, and has ever since gone on increasing in
value, the accessions in the 18th century alone being enough to
double its former importance. The printed books it contains are
probably no more than 11,000 in number, but are almost all of the
highest rarity and interest, including 242 incunabula of which 151
<i>editiones principes</i>. It is, however, the precious collection of MSS.,
amounting to 9693 articles, which gives its chief importance to this
library. They comprise more than 700 of dates earlier than the
11th century. Some of them are the most valuable codices in the
world&mdash;the famous Virgil of the 4th or 5th century, Justinian&rsquo;s
<i>Pandects</i> of the 6th, a Homer of the 10th, and several other very
early Greek and Latin classical and Biblical texts, as well as copies
in the handwriting of Petrarch, about 100 codices of Dante, a
<i>Decameron</i> copied by a contemporary from Boccaccio&rsquo;s own MS., and
Cellini&rsquo;s MS. of his autobiography. Bandini&rsquo;s catalogue of the MSS.
occupies 13 vols. folio, printed in 1764-1778. Administratively
united to the Laurentian is the Riccardiana rich in MSS. of Italian
literature, especially the Florentine (33,000 vols., 3905 MSS.). At
Florence the Biblioteca Marucelliana, founded in 1703, remarkable for
its artistic wealth of early woodcuts and metal engravings, was
opened to the public in 1753. The number of these and of original
drawings by the old masters amounts to 80,000 pieces; the printed
volumes number 200,000, the incunabula 620, and the MSS. 1500.
<span class="sidenote">Modena.</span>
At Modena is the famous Biblioteca Estense, so called from
having been founded by the Este family at Ferrara in
1393; it was transferred to Modena by Cesare D&rsquo;Este in 1598.
Muratori, Zaccaria and Tiraboschi were librarians here, and made
good use of the treasures of the library. It is particularly rich in
early printed literature and valuable codices. Between 1859 and
1867 it was known as the Biblioteca Palatina. The printed vols.
number 150,570, the incunabula 1600, the MSS. 3336, besides the
4958 MSS. and the 100,000 autographs of the Campori collection.</p>

<p>The oldest library at Naples is the Biblioteca Brancacciana, with
many valuable MSS. relating to the history of Naples. Two planispheres
by Coronelli are preserved here. It was founded
in 1673 by Cardinal F. M. Brancaccio, and opened by his
<span class="sidenote">Parma.</span>
heirs in 1675; 150,000 vols. and 3000 MSS. The Regia Biblioteca di
Parma, founded definitively in 1779, owes its origin to the grand-duke
Philip, who employed the famous scholar Paciaudi to organize it. It
is now a public library containing 308,770 vols. and 4890 MSS.
Amongst its treasures is De Rossi&rsquo;s magnificent collection of Biblical
and rabbinical MSS. Also worthy of note are the Bibl. Pubblica or
governation of Lucca (1600) with 214,000 vols., 725 incunabula and
3091 MSS. and that of Cremona (1774), united to that of the Museo
Civico.</p>

<p>Among the great libraries not under government control, the most
important is the famous Biblioteca Ambrosiana at Milan, founded
in 1609 by Cardinal Fed. Borromeo. It contains 230,000
printed vols. and 8400 MSS. Amongst the MSS. are a
<span class="sidenote">Ambrosiana.</span>
Greek Pentateuch of the 5th century, the famous Peshito
and Syro-Hexaplar from the Nitrian convent of St Maria Deipara, a
Josephus written on papyrus, supposed to be of the 5th century,
several palimpsest texts, including an early Plautus, and St Jerome&rsquo;s
commentary on the Psalms in a volume of 7th-century execution, full
of contemporary glosses in Irish, Gothic fragments of Ulfilas, and a
Virgil with notes in Petrarch&rsquo;s handwriting. Cardinal Mai Was
formerly custodian here. In 1879 Professor C. Mensinger presented
his &ldquo;Biblioteca Europea,&rdquo; consisting of 2500 vols., 300 maps and
5000 pieces, all relating to the literature and linguistics of European
countries. The Melzi and Trivulzio libraries should not pass without
mention here, although they are private and inaccessible without
special permission. The former is remarkable for its collection of
early editions with engravings, including the Dante of 1481, with
twenty designs by Baccio Bandinelli. The latter is rich in MSS.
with miniatures of the finest and rarest kind, and in printed books
of which many are unique or nearly so. It consists of 70,000 printed
vols. At Genoa the Biblioteca Franzoniana, founded about 1770 for
the instruction of the poorer classes, is noteworthy as being the first
European library lighted up at night for the use of readers.</p>

<p>The foundation of the monastery of Monte Cassino is due to St
Benedict, who arrived there in the year 529, and established the
prototype of all similar institutions in western Europe.
The library of printed books now extends to about 20,000
<span class="sidenote">Monte Cassino.</span>
vols., chiefly relating to the theological sciences, but including
some rare editions. A collection of the books belonging to
the monks contains about the same number of volumes. But the
chief glory of Monte Cassino consists of the <i>archivio</i>, which is quite
apart; and this includes more than 30,000 bulls, diplomas, charters
and other documents, besides 1000 MSS. dating from the 6th century
downwards. The latter comprehend some very early Bibles and
important codices of patristic and other medieval writings. There
are good written catalogues, and descriptions with extracts are
published in the <i>Bibliotheca Casinensis</i>. The monastery was declared
a national monument in 1866. At Ravenna the Biblioteca Classense
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page574" id="page574"></a>574</span>
has a 10th-century codex of Aristophanes and two 14th-century
codices of Dante. At Vercelli the Biblioteca dell&rsquo; Archivio Capitolare,
<span class="sidenote">Vercelli.</span>
the foundation of which can be assigned to no certain date,
but must be referred to the early days when the barbarous
conquerors of Italy had become christianized, comprises nothing but
MSS., all of great antiquity and value. Amongst them is an Evangeliarium
S. Eusebii in Latin, supposed to be of the 4th century; also
the famous codex containing the Anglo-Saxon homilies which have
been published by the Ælfric Society.</p>

<p>The Biblioteca del Monastero della S. Trinità, at La Cava dei
Tirreni in the province of Salerno, is said to date from the foundation
of the abbey itself (beginning of the 11th century). It
contains only some 10,000 vols., but these include a
<span class="sidenote">La Cava.</span>
number of MSS. of very great rarity and value, ranging from the
8th to the 14th century. Amongst these is the celebrated Codex
Legum Longobardorum, dated 1004, besides a well-known geographical
chart of the 12th century, over 100 Greek MSS., and about 1000
charters beginning with the year 840, more than 200 of which belong
to the Lombard and Norman periods. The library is now national
property, the abbot holding the office of Keeper of the Archives.</p>

<p>Not a few of the communal and municipal libraries are of great
extent and interest: Bologna (1801), 191,000 vols., 5060 MSS.;
Brescia, Civica Quiriniana, 125,000 vols., 1500 MSS.; Ferrara (1753),
91,000 vols., 1698 MSS., many Ferrarese rarities; Macerata, the
Mozzi-Borgetti (1783-1835, united 1855), 50,000 vols.; Mantua,
70,000 vols., 1300 MSS.; Novara, Negroni e Civica (1847 and 1890),
75,000 vols.; Padua, 90,000 vols., 1600 MSS.; Palermo (1760),
216,000 vols., 3263 MSS., coins and Sicilian collection; Perugia
(1852), founded by P. Podiani, 70,000 vols., 915 MSS.; Siena
(1758), founded by S. Bandini, fine art collection, 83,250 vols., 5070
MSS.; Venice, Museo Civico Correr, 50,000 vols., 11,000 MSS.;
Verona (1792, public since 1802), 180,000 vols., 2650 MSS.; Vicenza,
Bertoliana (1708), local literature, archives of religious corporations,
175,000 vols., 6000 MSS.</p>

<p>Popular libraries have now been largely developed in Italy, chiefly
through private or municipal enterprise; they enjoy a small state
subvention of £1000. The government report for 1908 stated that
319 communes possessed <i>biblioteche popolari</i> numbering altogether
415. Of these, 313 were established by municipalities, 113 by
individuals, 8 by business houses, 80 by working men&rsquo;s societies and
15 by ministers of religion; 225 are open to the public, 358 lend
books, 221 gratuitously, and 127 on payment of a small fee. In order
to establish these institutions throughout the kingdom, a <i>Bollettino</i>
has been published at Milan since 1907, and a National Congress was
held at Rome in December 1908.</p>

<p>Much interest in libraries has not been shown in south, central
and other parts of Latin America. Most of the libraries which
exist are national or legislative libraries.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>As the libraries of the republic of Cuba are more Spanish than
American in character, it will be convenient to consider them here.
<span class="sidenote">Cuba.</span>
The chief libraries are in Havana, and the best are the
Biblioteca Publica and the University Library. The
Biblioteca Publica has within recent years been completely overhauled,
and is now one of the most actively-managed libraries in
Latin America.</p>

<p>Out of the twenty-nine states and territories of the Mexican
republic about half have public libraries, and only a small proportion
of the contents consists of modern literature. Many
possess rare and valuable books, of interest to the bibliographer
<span class="sidenote">Mexico.</span>
and historian, which have come from the libraries of the suppressed
religious bodies. There is a large number of scientific and
literary associations in the republic, each possessing books. The Society
of Geography and Statistics, founded in 1851 in Mexico City,
is the most important of them, and owns a fine museum and excellent
library. After the triumph of the Liberal party the cathedral, university
and conventual libraries of the city of Mexico came into the
possession of the government, and steps were taken to form them into
one national collection. No definite system was organized, however,
until 1867, when the church of San Augustin was taken and fitted up
for the purpose. In 1884 it was opened as the Biblioteca Nacional,
and now possesses over 200,000 vols. Two copies of every book
printed in Mexico must be presented to this library. Most of the
libraries of Mexico, city or provincial, are subscription, and belong
to societies and schools of various kinds.</p>

<p>The importance of public libraries has been fully recognized in
Argentina, and more than two hundred of them are in the country.
They are due to benefactions, but the government in every
case adds an equal sum to any endowment. A central
<span class="sidenote">Argentina.</span>
commission exists for the purpose of facilitating the acquisition
of books and to promote a uniform excellence of administration.
The most considerable is the Biblioteca Nacional at Buenos
Aires, which is passably rich in MSS., some of great interest, concerning
the early history of the Spanish colonies. There is also the
Biblioteca Municipal with about 25,000 vols. There are libraries
attached to colleges, churches and clubs, and most of the larger
towns possess public libraries.</p>

<p>The chief library in Brazil is the Bibliotheca Publica Nacional
at Rio de Janeiro (1807) now comprising over 250,000 printed
vols. with many MSS. National literature and works
connected with South America are special features of this
<span class="sidenote">Brazil.</span>
collection. A handsome new building has been erected which has
been fitted up in the most modern manner. Among other libraries
of the capital may be mentioned those of the Faculty of Medicine,
Marine Library, National Museum, Portuguese Literary Club,
Bibliotheca Fluminense, Benedictine Monastery, and the Bibliotheca
Municipal. There are various provincial and public libraries throughout
Brazil, doing good work, and a typical example is the public
library of Maranhao.</p>

<p>The Biblioteca Nacional at Santiago is the chief library in Chile.
<span class="sidenote">Chile.</span>
The catalogue is printed, and is kept up by annual supplements.
It possesses about 100,000 vols. There is also a
University Library at Santiago, and a fairly good Biblioteca Publica
at Valparaiso.</p>

<p>The Biblioteca Nacional at Lima was founded by a decree of the
liberator San Martin on the 28th of August 1821, and placed in the
<span class="sidenote">Peru.</span>
house of the old convent of San Pedro. The nucleus of the
library consisted of those of the university of San Marcos
and of several monasteries, and a large present of books was also made
by San Martin. The library is chiefly interesting from containing
so many MSS. and rare books relating to the history of Peru in viceregal
times.</p>

<p class="pt1 center"><i>Spain and Portugal.</i></p>

<p>Most of the royal, state and university libraries of Spain and
Portugal have government control and support. In Portugal
the work of the universities is to a certain extent connected up,
and an official bulletin is published in which the laws and accessions
of the libraries are contained.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The chief library in Spain is the Biblioteca Nacional (formerly the
Biblioteca Real) at Madrid. The printed volumes number 600,000
with 200,000 pamphlets. Spanish literature is of course well
represented, and, in consequence of the numerous accessions from
the libraries of the suppressed convents, the classes of theology,
canon law, history, &amp;c., are particularly complete. There are 30,000
MSS., including some finely illuminated codices, historical documents,
and many valuable autographs. The collection of prints extends to
120,000 pieces, and was principally formed from the important series
bought from Don Valentin Carderera in 1865. The printed books
have one catalogue arranged under authors&rsquo; names, and one under
titles; the departments of music, maps and charts, and prints have
subject-catalogues as well. There is a general index of the MSS.,
with special catalogues of the Greek and Latin codices and genealogical
documents. The cabinet of medals is most valuable and well
arranged. Of the other Madrid libraries it is enough to mention the
Biblioteca de la Real Academia de la Historia, 1758 (20,000 vols. and
1500 MSS.), which contains some printed and MS. Spanish books of
great value, including the well-known Salazar collection. The history
of the library of the Escorial (<i>q.v.</i>) has been given elsewhere. In
1808, before the invasion, the Escorial is estimated to have contained
30,000 printed vols. and 3400 MSS.; Joseph removed the collection
to Madrid, but when it was returned by Ferdinand 10,000 vols. were
missing. There are now about 40,000 printed vols. The Arabic
MSS. have been described by M. Casiri, 1760-1770; and a catalogue
of the Greek codices by Müller was issued at the expense of the French
government in 1848. There is a MS. catalogue of the printed books.
Permission to study at the Escorial, which is one of the royal private
libraries, must be obtained by special application. The Biblioteca
Provincial y Universitaria of Barcelona (1841) contains about
155,000 vols., and that of Seville (1767) has 82,000 vols. Other cities
in Spain possess provincial or university libraries open to students
under various restrictions, among them may be mentioned the
Biblioteca Universitaria of Salamanca (1254) with over 80,000 vols.</p>

<p>Among the libraries of Portugal the Bibliotheca Nacional at Lisbon
(1796) naturally takes the first place. In 1841 it was largely increased
from the monastic collections, which, however, seem to
have been little cared for according to a report prepared
<span class="sidenote">Portugal.</span>
by the principal librarian three years later. There are now said to
be 400,000 vols. of printed books, among which theology, canon law,
history and Portuguese and Spanish literature largely predominate.
The MSS. number 16,000 including many of great value. There is
also a cabinet of 40,000 coins and medals. The Bibliotheca da
Academia, founded in 1780, is preserved in the suppressed convent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page575" id="page575"></a>575</span>
of the Ordem Terceira da Penitencia. In 1836 the Academy acquired
the library of that convent, numbering 30,000 vols., which have since
been kept apart. The Archivo Nacional, in the same building,
contains the archives of the kingdom, brought here after the destruction
of the Torre do Castello during the great earthquake.</p>

<p>The Biblioteca Publica Municipal at Oporto is the second largest
in Portugal, although only dating from the 9th of July 1833, the
anniversary of the debarcation of D. Pedro, and when the memorable
siege was still in progress; from that date to 1874 it was styled the
Real Biblioteca do Porto. The regent (ex-emperor of Brazil) gave to
the town the libraries of the suppressed convents in the northern
provinces, the municipality undertaking to defray the expense of
keeping up the collection. Recent accessions consist mainly of
Portuguese and French books. The important Camoens collection is
described in a printed catalogue (Oporto, 1880). A notice of the MSS.
may be found in <i>Catalogo dos MSS. da B. Publica Eborense</i>, by H.
da Cunha Rivara (Lisbon, 1850-1870), 3 vols. folio, and the first part
of an <i>Indice preparatorio do Catalogo dos Manuscriptos</i> was produced
in 1880. The University Library of Coimbra (1591) contains about
100,000 vols., and other colleges possess libraries.</p>
</div>

<p class="pt1 center"><i>Netherlands.</i></p>

<p>Since 1900 there has been considerable progress made in both
Belgium and Holland in the development of public libraries, and
several towns in the latter country have established popular
libraries after the fashion of the municipal libraries of the
United Kingdom and America.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The national library of Belgium is the Bibliothèque Royale at
Brussels, of which the basis may be said to consist of the famous
Bibliothèque des ducs de Bourgogne, the library of the
Austrian sovereigns of the Low Countries, which had
<span class="sidenote">Belgium.</span>
gradually accumulated during three centuries. After suffering many
losses from thieves and fire, in 1772 the Bibliothèque de Bourgogne
received considerable augmentations from the libraries of the suppressed
order of Jesuits, and was thrown open to the public. On
the occupation of Brussels by the French in 1794 a number of books
and MSS. were confiscated and transferred to Paris (whence the
majority were returned in 1815); in 1795 the remainder were formed
into a public library under the care of La Serna Santander, who was
also town librarian, and who was followed by van Hulthem. At the
end of the administration of van Hulthem a large part of the precious
collections of the Bollandists was acquired. In 1830 the Bibliothèque
de Bourgogne was added to the state archives, and the whole made
available for students. Van Hulthem died in 1832, leaving one of
the most important private libraries in Europe, described by Voisin
in <i>Bibliotheca Hulthemiana</i> (Brussels, 1836), 5 vols., and extending to
60,000 printed vols, and 1016 MSS., mostly relating to Belgian
history. The collection was purchased by the government in 1837,
and, having been added to the Bibliothèque de Bourgogne (open
since 1772) and the Bibliothèque de la Ville (open since 1794),
formed what has since been known as the Bibliothèque Royale de
Belgique. The printed volumes now number over 600,000 with
30,000 MSS., 105,000 prints and 80,000 coins and medals. The
special collections, each with a printed catalogue, consist of the
Fonds van Hulthem, for national history; the Fonds Fétis, for
music; the Fonds Goethals, for genealogy; and the Fonds Müller,
for physiology. The catalogue of the MSS. has been partly printed,
and catalogues of accessions and other departments are also in course
of publication. There are libraries attached to most of the departments
of the government, the ministry of war having 120,000 vols.
and the ministry of the interior, 15,000 vols. An interesting library
is the Bibliothèque Collective des Sociétés Savantes founded in 1906
to assemble in one place the libraries of all the learned societies of
Brussels. It contains about 40,000 vols. which have been catalogued
on cards. The Bibliothèque du Conservatoire royal de Musique
(1832) contains 12,000 vols, and 6000 dramatic works. The popular
or communal libraries of Brussels contain about 30,000 vols. and
those of the adjoining suburbs about 50,000 vols., most of which are
distributed through the primary and secondary schools. At Antwerp
the Stadt Bibliothek (1805) has now 70,000 vols., and is partly supported
by subscriptions and endowments. The valuable collection
of books in the Musée Plantin-Moretus (1640) should also be
mentioned. It contains 11,000 MSS. and 15,000 printed books,
comprising the works issued by the Plantin family and many 15th-century
books.</p>

<p>The University Library of Ghent, known successively as the
Bibliothèque de l&rsquo;École Centrale and Bibliothèque Publique de la
Ville, was founded upon the old libraries of the Conseil de Flandres,
of the College des Échevins, and of many suppressed religious communities.
It was declared public in 1797, and formally opened in
1798. On the foundation of the university in 1817 the town placed the
collection at its disposal, and the library has since remained under
state control. The printed volumes now amount to 353,000. There
are important special collections on archaeology, Netherlands literature,
national history, books printed in Flanders, and 23,000 historical
pamphlets of the 16th and 17th centuries. The main catalogue is in
MS. on cards. There are printed catalogues of the works on jurisprudence
(1839), and of the MSS. (1852). The Bibliothèque de
l&rsquo;Université Catholique of Louvain is based upon the collection of
Beyerlinck, who bequeathed it to his alma mater in 1627; this
example was followed by Jacques Romain, professor of medicine,
but the proper organization of the library began in 1636. There are
now said to be 211,000 vols. The Bibliothèque de l&rsquo;Université of
Liége dates from 1817, when on the foundation of the university
the old Bibliothèque de la Ville was added to it. There are now
350,000 printed vols., pamphlets, MSS., &amp;c. The Liége collection
(of which a printed catalogue appeared in 3 vols. 8vo., 1872), bequeathed
by M. Ulysse Capitaine, extends to 12,061 vols. and
pamphlets. There are various printed catalogues. The Bibliothèques
Populaires of Liége established in 1862, now number five, and contain
among them 50,000 vols. which are circulated to the extent of
130,000 per annum among the school children. The Bibliothèque
publique of Bruges (1798) contains 145,600 printed books and MSS.,
housed in a very artistic building, once the Tonlieu or douane, 1477.
There are communal libraries at Alost, Arlon (1842), Ath (1842),
Courtrai, Malines (1864), Mons (1797), Namur (1800), Ostend (1861),
Tournai (1794, housed in the Hôtel des Anciens Prêtres, 1755),
Ypres (1839) and elsewhere, all conducted on the same system as the
French communal libraries. Most of them range in size from 5000
to 40,000 vols, and they are open as a rule only part of the day.
Every small town has a similar library, and a complete list of them,
together with much other information, will be found in the <i>Annuaire
de la Belgique, scientifique, artistique et littéraire</i> (Brussels 1908 and
later issues).</p>

<p>The national library of Holland is the Koninklijke Bibliotheek at Hague, which was established in 1798, when it was decided to
join the library of the princes of Orange with those of the
defunct government bodies in order to form a library for
the States-General, to be called the <span class="correction" title="amended from National">Nationale</span> Bibliotheek. In 1805
<span class="sidenote">Holland.</span>
the present name was adopted; and since 1815 it has become the
national library. In 1848 the Baron W. Y. H. van Westreenen van
Tiellandt bequeathed his valuable books, MSS., coins and antiquities
to the country, and directed that they should be preserved in his
former residence as a branch of the royal library. There are now
upwards of 500,000 vols. of printed books, and the MSS. number
6000, chiefly historical, but including many fine books of hours with
miniatures. Books are lent all over the country. The library boasts
of the richest collection in the world of books on chess, Dutch
incunabula, Elzevirs and Spinozana. There is one general written
catalogue arranged in classes, with alphabetical indexes. In 1800
a printed catalogue was issued, with four supplements down to 1811;
and since 1866 a yearly list of additions has been published. Special
mention should be made of the excellent catalogue of the incunabula
published in 1856.</p>

<p>The next library in numerical importance is the famous Bibliotheca
Academiae Lugduno-Batavae, which dates from the foundation of
the university of Leiden by William I., prince of Orange, on the 8th
of February 1575. It has acquired many valuable additions from
the books and MSS. of the distinguished scholars, Golius, Joseph
Scaliger, Isaac Voss, Ruhnken and Hemsterhuis. The MSS. comprehend
many of great intrinsic importance. The library of the Society
of Netherland Literature has been placed here since 1877; this is
rich in the national history and literature. The Arabic and Oriental
MSS. known as the Legatum Warnerianum are of great value and
interest; and the collection of maps bequeathed in 1870 by J. J.
Bodel Nyenhuis is also noteworthy. The library is contained in a
building which was formerly a church of the Béguines, adapted in
1860 somewhat after the style of the British Museum. The catalogues
(one alphabetical and one classified) are on slips, the titles being
printed. A catalogue of books and MSS. was printed in 1716, one of
books added between 1814 and 1847 and a supplementary part of
MSS. only in 1850. A catalogue of the Oriental MSS. was published
in 6 vols. (1851-1877). The Bibliotheek der Rijks Universiteit (1575)
at Leiden contains over 190,000 vols.</p>

<p>The University Library at Utrecht dates from 1582, when certain
conventual collections were brought together in order to form a
public library, which was shortly afterwards enriched by the books
bequeathed by Hub. Buchelius and Ev. Pollio. Upon the foundation
of the university in 1636, the town library passed into its charge.
Among the MSS. are some interesting cloister MSS. and the famous
&ldquo;Utrecht Psalter,&rdquo; which contains the oldest text of the Athanasian
creed. The last edition of the catalogue was in 2 vols. folio, 1834,
with supplement in 1845, index from 1845-1855 in 8vo., and additions
1856-1870, 2 vols. 8vo. A catalogue of the MSS. was issued in 1887.
The titles of accessions are now printed in sheets and pasted down for
insertion. There are now about 250,000 vols. in the library.</p>

<p>The basis of the University Library at Amsterdam consists of a
collection of books brought together in the 15th century and preserved
in the Nieuwe Kerk. At the time of the Reformation in 1578
they became the property of the city, but remained in the Nieuwe
Kerk for the use of the public till 1632, when they were transferred
to the Athenaeum. Since 1877 the collection has been known as the
University Library, and in 1881 it was removed to a building designed
upon the plan of the new library and reading-room of the
British Museum. The library includes the best collection of medical
works in Holland, and the Bibliotheca Rosenthaliana of Hebrew and
Talmudic literature is of great fame and value; a catalogue of the
last was printed in 1875. The libraries of the Dutch Geographical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page576" id="page576"></a>576</span>
and other societies are preserved here. A general printed catalogue
was issued in 6 vols. 8vo., Amsterdam (1856-1877); one describing
the bequests of J. de Bosch Kemper, E. J. Potgieter and F. W. Rive,
in 3 vols., 8vo. (1878-1879); a catalogue of the MSS. of Professor
Moll was published in 1880, and one of those of P. Camper in 1881.
Other catalogues have been published up to 1902, including one of
the MSS. The library contains about half a million volumes. There
are popular subscription libraries with reading-rooms in all parts of
Holland, and in Rotterdam there is a society for the encouragement
of social culture which has a large library as part of its equipment.
At Hague, Leiden, Haarlem, Dordrecht and other towns popular
libraries have been established, and there is a movement of recent
growth, in favour of training librarians on advanced English lines.</p>

<p>The library of the Genootschap van Kunsten en Wetenschappen at
Batavia contains books printed in Netherlandish India, works relating
to the Indian Archipelago and adjacent countries, and the
history of the Dutch in the East. There are 20,000 printed vols. and
1630 MSS., of which 243 are Arabic, 445 Malay, 303 Javanese, 60
Batak and 517 on lontar leaves, in the ancient Kawi, Javanese
and Bali languages, &amp;c. Printed catalogues of the Arabic, Malay,
Javanese and Kawi MSS. have been issued.</p>
</div>

<p class="pt1 center"><i>Scandinavia.</i></p>

<p>Owing largely to so many Scandinavian librarians having
been trained and employed in American libraries, a greater
approach has been made to Anglo-American library ideals in
Norway, Sweden and Denmark than anywhere else on the
continent of Europe.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The beginning of the admirably managed national library of
Denmark, the great Royal Library at Copenhagen (Det Store
Kongelige Bibliothek) may be said to have taken place
during the reign of Christian III. (1533-1559), who took
<span class="sidenote">Denmark.</span>
pride in importing foreign books and choice MSS.; but the true
founder was Frederick III. (1648-1670); to him is mainly due the
famous collection of Icelandic literature and the acquisition of Tycho
Brahe&rsquo;s MSS. The present building (in the Christiansborg castle)
was begun in 1667. Among notable accessions may be mentioned
the collections of C. Reitzer, the count of Danneskjöld (8000 vols.
and 500 MSS.) and Count de Thott; the last bequeathed 6039 vols.
printed before 1531, and the remainder of his books, over 100,000
vols., was eventually purchased. In 1793 the library was opened to
the public, and it has since remained under state control. Two copies
of every book published within the kingdom must be deposited here.
The incunabula and block books form an important series. There is
a general classified catalogue in writing for the use of readers; and
an alphabetical one on slips arranged in boxes for the officials. A
good catalogue of the de Thott collection was printed in 12 vols. 8vo.
(1789-1795); a catalogue of the French MSS. appeared in 1844;
of Oriental MSS., 1846; of the Danish collection, 1875, 8vo. Annual
reports and accounts of notable MSS. have been published since 1864.
The library now contains over 750,000 vols.</p>

<p>The University Library, founded in 1482, was destroyed by fire
in 1728, and re-established shortly afterwards. A copy of every
Danish publication must be deposited here. The MSS. include the
famous Arne-Magnean collection. There are now about 400,000
vols. in this library. The Statsbiblioteket of Aarhus (1902) possesses
about 200,000 vols. and the Landsbókasafn Islands (National
Library) of Reykjavik, Iceland, has about 50,000 printed books and
5500 MSS. In Copenhagen there are 11 popular libraries supported
in part by the city, and there are at least 50 towns in the provinces
with public libraries and in some cases reading-rooms. An association
for promoting public libraries was formed in 1905, and in 1909
the minister of public instruction appointed a special adviser in
library matters. About 800 towns and villages are aided by the
above named association, the state and local authorities, and it is
estimated that they possess among them 500,000 vols., and circulate
over 1,000,000 vols. annually.</p>

<p>The chief library in Norway is the University Library at Christiania,
established at the same time as the university, September 2nd, 1811,
by Frederick II., with a donation from the king of many
thousands of duplicates from the Royal Library at
<span class="sidenote">Norway.</span>
Copenhagen, and since augmented by important bequests. Annual
catalogues are issued and there are now over 420,000 vols. in the
collection. The Deichmanske Bibliothek in Christiania was founded
by Carl Deichmann in 1780 as a free library. In 1898 it was reorganized,
and in 1903 the open shelf method was installed by Haakon
Nyhuus, the librarian, who had been trained in the United States.
The library is partly supported by endowment, partly by grants from
the municipality. It now contains about 85,000 vols., and is a typical
example of a progressive library. The Free Library at Bergen (1872)
has about 90,000 vols. and has recently been re-housed in a new
building. A free library, with open shelves, has also been opened at
Trondhjem. The library connected with the Kongellige Videnskabers
Selskab at Trondhjem now contains about 120,000 vols.
Owing to the absence of small towns and villages in Norway, most of
the library work is concentrated in the coast towns.</p>

<p>The Royal Library at Stockholm was first established in 1585.
The original collection was given to the university of Upsala by
Gustavus II., that formed by Christina is at the Vatican, and the
library brought together by Charles X. was destroyed by fire in 1697.
<span class="sidenote">Sweden.</span>
The present library was organized shortly afterwards.
The Benzelstjerna-Engeström Library (14,500 printed
vols. and 1200 MSS.) rich in materials for Swedish history, is now
annexed to it. Natural history, medicine and mathematics are left
to other libraries. Among the MSS. the <i>Codex Aureus</i> of the 6th or
7th century, with its interesting Anglo-Saxon inscription, is particularly
noteworthy. The catalogues are in writing, and are both
alphabetical and classified; printed catalogues have been issued of
portions of the MSS. The present building was opened in 1882.
The library now contains about 320,000 printed books and over
11,000 MSS. The Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, contains a
library of medical books numbering over 40,000.</p>

<p>The University Library at Upsala was founded by Gustavus
Adolphus in 1620, from the remains of several convent libraries; he
also provided an endowment. The MSS. chiefly relate to the history
of the country, but include the <i>Codex Argenteus</i>, containing the Gothic
gospels of Ulfilas. The general catalogue is in writing. A catalogue
was printed in 1814; special lists of the foreign accessions have been
published each year from 1850; the Arabic, Persian and Turkish
MSS. are described by C. J. Tornberg, 1846. It now contains about
340,000 printed books and MSS. The library at Lund dates from the
foundation of the university in 1668, and was based upon the old
cathedral library. The MSS. include the de la Gardie archives,
acquired in 1848. There are about 200,000 vols. in the library.
The Stadsbibliotek of Gothenburg contains about 100,000 vols.,
and has a printed catalogue.</p>

<p class="pt1 center"><i>Russia.</i></p>

<p>The imperial Public Library at St Petersburg is one of the
largest libraries in the world, and now possesses about 1,800,000
printed vols. and 34,000 MSS., as well as large collections of
maps, autographs, photographs, &amp;c. The beginning of this
magnificent collection may be said to have been the books
seized by the Czar Peter during his invasion of Courland in 1714;
the library did not receive any notable augmentation, however,
till the year 1795, when, by the acquisition of the famous Zaluski
collection, the Imperial Library suddenly attained a place in the
first rank among great European libraries. The Zaluski Library
was formed by the Polish count Joseph Zaluski, who collected
at his own expense during forty-three years no less than 200,000
vols., which were added to by his brother Andrew, bishop of
Cracow, by whom in 1747 the library was thrown open to the
public. At his death it was left under the control of the Jesuit
College at Warsaw; on the suppression of the order it was
taken care of by the Commission of Education; and finally in
1795 it was transferred by Suwaroff to St Petersburg as a trophy
of war. It then extended to 260,000 printed vols. and 10,000
MSS., but in consequence of the withdrawal of many medical
and illustrated works to enrich other institutions, hardly 238,000
vols. remained in 1810. Literature, history and theology formed
the main features of the Zaluski Library; the last class
alone amounted to one-fourth of the whole number. Since the
beginning of the 19th century, through the liberality of the
sovereigns, the gifts of individuals, careful purchases, and the
application of the law of 1810, whereby two copies of every
Russian publication must be deposited here, the Imperial Library
has attained its present extensive dimensions. Nearly one
hundred different collections, some of them very valuable and
extensive, have been added from time to time. They include,
for example, the Tolstoi Sclavonic collection (1830), Tischendorf&rsquo;s
MSS. (1858), the Dolgorousky Oriental MSS. (1859), and the
Firkowitsch Hebrew (Karaite) collection (1862-1863), the
libraries of Adelung (1858) and Tobler (1877), that of the Slavonic
scholar Jungmann (1856), and the national MSS. of Karamzin
(1867). This system of acquiring books, while it has made some
departments exceedingly rich, has left others comparatively
meagre. The library was not regularly opened to the public
until 1814; it is under the control of the minister of public
instruction. There are fine collections of Aldines and Elzevirs,
and the numerous incunabula are instructively arranged.</p>

<p>The manuscripts include 26,000 codices, 41,340 autographs,
4689 charters and 576 maps. The glory of this department is
the celebrated <i>Codex Sinaiticus</i> of the Greek Bible, brought from
the convent of St Catherine on Mount Sinai by Tischendorf in
1859. Other important Biblical and patristic codices are to be
found among the Greek, and Latin MSS.; the Hebrew MSS.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page577" id="page577"></a>577</span>
include some of the most ancient that exist, and the Samaritan
collection is one of the largest in Europe; the Oriental MSS.
comprehend many valuable texts, and among the French are
some of great historical value. The general catalogues are in
writing, but many special catalogues of the MSS. and printed
books have been published.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The nucleus of the library at the Hermitage Palace was formed by
the empress Catherine II., who purchased the books and MSS. of
Voltaire and Diderot. In the year 1861 the collection amounted to
150,000 vols., of which nearly all not relating to the history of art
were then transferred to the Imperial Library. There are many
large and valuable libraries attached to the government departments
in St Petersburg, and most of the academies and colleges and
learned societies are provided with libraries.</p>

<p>The second largest library in Russia is contained in the Public
Museum at Moscow. The class of history is particularly rich, and
Russian early printed books are well represented. The MSS. number
5000, including many ancient Sclavonic codices and historical documents
of value. One room is devoted to a collection of Masonic
MSS., which comprehend the archives of the lodges in Russia between
1816 and 1821. There is a general alphabetical catalogue in writing;
the catalogue of the MSS. has been printed, as well as those of some
of the special collections. This large and valuable library now
contains close upon 1,000,000 printed books and MSS. The Imperial
University at Moscow (1755) has a library of over 310,000 vols., and
the Duchovnaja Academy has 120,000 vols. The Imperial Russian
Historical Museum (1875-1883) in Moscow contains nearly 200,000
vols. and most of the state institutions and schools are supplied
with libraries. All the Russian universities have libraries, some of
them being both large and valuable&mdash;Dorpat (1802) 400,000 vols.;
Charkov (1804) 180,000 vols.; Helsingfors (1640-1827) 193,000
vols.; Kasan (1804) 242,000 vols.; Kiev (1832) 125,000 vols.;
Odessa (1865) 250,000 vols.; and Warsaw (1817) 550,000 vols. There
are also communal or public libraries at Charkov (1886) 110,000
vols.; Odessa (1830) 130,000 vols.; Reval (1825) 40,000 vols.;
Riga, 90,000 vols.; Vilna (1856) 210,000 vols. and many other towns.
A text-book on library economy, based on Graesel and Brown, was
issued at St Petersburg in 1904.</p>

<p class="pt1 center"><i>Eastern Europe.</i></p>

<p>At Athens the National Library (1842) possesses about
260,000 vols., and there is also a considerable library at
the university. The Public Library at Corfu has about 40,000
vols. Belgrade University Library has 60,000 vols. and the
University Library of Sofia has 30,000 vols. Constantinople
University in 1910 had a library in process of formation, and
there are libraries at the Greek Literary Society (20,000 vols.)
and Theological School (11,000 vols.).</p>

<p class="pt1 center"><i>China.</i></p>

<p>Chinese books were first written on thin slips of bamboo, which
were replaced by silk or cloth scrolls in the 3rd century <span class="scs">B.C.</span>,
paper coming into use in the beginning of the 2nd century.
These methods were customary down to the 10th or 11th century.
There were no public libraries in the western sense.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The practice of forming national collections of the native literature
originated in the attempts to recover the works destroyed in the
&ldquo;burning of the books&rdquo; by the &ldquo;First Emperor&rdquo; (220 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>). In
190 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> the law for the suppression of literary works was repealed,
but towards the close of the 1st century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> many works were still
missing. Hsiao Wu (139-86 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) formed the plan of Repositories,
in which books might be stored, with officers to transcribe them.
Liu Hsiang (80-9 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) was specially appointed to classify the
literature and form a library. His task was completed by his son,
and the <i>resumé</i> of their labours is a detailed catalogue with valuable
notes describing 11,332 &ldquo;sections&rdquo; (volumes) by 625 authors.
Similar national collections were formed by nearly every succeeding
dynasty. The high estimation in which literature has always been
held has led to the formation of very large imperial, official and
private collections of books. Large numbers of works, chiefly relating
to Buddhism and Taoism, are also stored in many of the
temples. Chinese books are usually in several, and frequently in
many volumes. The histories and encyclopaedias are mostly of vast
dimensions. Collections of books are kept in wooden cupboards or
on open shelves, placed on their sides, each set (<i>t&rsquo;ao</i>) of volumes
(<i>pên</i>) being protected and held together by two thin wooden or
card boards, one forming the front cover (in a European book) and
the other the back cover, joined by two cords or tapes running round
the whole. By untying and tying these tapes the <i>t&rsquo;ao</i> is opened and
closed. The titles of the whole work and of each section are written
on the edge (either the top or bottom in a European book) and so
face outwards as it lies on the shelf. Catalogues are simple lists
with comments on the books, not the systematic and scientific
productions used in Western countries. There are circulating libraries
in large numbers in Peking, Canton and other cities.</p>

<p class="pt1 center"><i>Japan.</i></p>

<p>The ancient history of libraries in Japan is analogous to that
of China, with whose civilization and literature it had close
relations. Since about 1870, however, the great cities and
institutions have established libraries on the European model.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Perhaps the most extensive library of the empire is that of the
Imperial Cabinet (1885) at Tokio with over 500,000 vols., consisting
of the collections of the various government departments, and is for
official use alone. The University Library (1872) is the largest open
to students and the public; it contains over 400,000 vols. of which
230,000 are Chinese and Japanese. The Public Library and reading-room
(Tosho-Kwan) at Ueno Park (1872) was formed in 1872 and
contains over 250,000 vols., of which about one-fifth are European
books. At Tokio are also to be found the Ohashi Library (1902) with
60,000 vols. and the Hibaya Library (1908) with 130,000 vols. and
the Nanki Library (1899) with 86,000 vols. The library of the
Imperial University of Kyoto contains nearly 200,000 vols., of which
over 90,000 are in European languages. To this is attached the
library of the Fukuoka Medical College with 113,000 vols. The
Municipal Library of Kyoto (1898) contains 46,000 vols. Other important
municipal libraries in Japan are those at Akita in the province
Of Ugo (1899), 47,000 vols., at Mito, province of Hitachi (1908),
25,000 vols., Narita, province of Shimosa (1901), 36,000 vols., chiefly
Buddhistic, Yamaguchi, province of Suó (1907), 23,000 vols. The
libraries of the large temples often contain books of value to the
philologist. Lending libraries of native and Chinese literature have
existed in Japan from very early times.</p>

<p class="pt2 center"><span class="sc">Library Associations and Training</span></p>

<p>The first and largest association established for the study of
librarianship was the American Library Association (1876). The
Library Association of the United Kingdom was formed in 1877
as an outcome of the first International Library Conference,
held at London, and in 1898 it received a royal charter. It
publishes a <i>Year Book</i>, the monthly <i>Library Association Record</i>,
and a number of professional handbooks. It also holds examinations
in Literary History, Bibliography and Library Economy,
and issues certificates and diplomas. There are also English
and Scottish district library associations. The Library Assistants
Association was formed in 1895 and has branches in different
parts of England, Wales and Ireland. It issues a monthly
magazine entitled <i>The Library Assistant</i>. There is an important
Library Association in Germany which issues a year-book giving
information concerning the libraries of the country, and a
similar organization in Austria-Hungary which issues a magazine
at irregular intervals. An Association of Archivists and Librarians
was formed at Brussels in 1907, and there are similar
societies in France, Italy, Holland and elsewhere. In every
country there is now some kind of association for the study of
librarianship, archives or bibliography. International conferences
have been held at London, 1877; London, 1897; Paris (at
Exhibition), 1903; St Louis, 1904; Brussels (preliminary),
1908; and Brussels, 1910.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIBYA,<a name="ar93" id="ar93"></a></span> the Greek name for the northern part of Africa, with
which alone Greek and Roman history are concerned. It is
mentioned as a land of great fertility in Homer (<i>Odyssey</i>, iv. 85),
but no indication of its extent is given. It did not originally
include Egypt, which was considered part of Asia, and first
assigned to Africa by Ptolemy, who made the isthmus of Suez
and the Red Sea the boundary between the two continents.
The name Africa came into general use through the Romans.
In the early empire, North Africa (excluding Egypt) was divided
into Mauretania, Numidia, Africa Propria and Cyrenaica. The
old name was reintroduced by Diocletian, by whom Cyrenaica
(detached from Crete) was divided into Marmarica (Libya
inferior) in the east, and Cyrenaica (Libya superior) in the west.
A further distinction into Libya interior and exterior is also
known. The former (<span class="grk" title="hê entós">&#7969; &#7952;&#957;&#964;&#972;&#962;</span>) included the interior (known
and unknown) of the continent, as contrasted with the N. and

<p><span class="bold">LICHENS,<a name="ar97" id="ar97"></a></span> in botany, compound or dual organisms each
consisting of an association of a higher fungus, with a usually
unicellular, sometimes filamentous, alga. The fungal part of
the organism nearly always consists of a number of the <i>Discomycetes</i>
or <i>Pyrenomycetes</i>, while the algal portion is a member
of the Schizophyceae (Cyanophyceae or Blue-green Algae) or
of the Green Algae; only in a very few cases is the fungus a
member of the Basidiomycetes. The special fungi which
take part in the association are, with rare exceptions, not
found growing separately, while the algal forms are constantly
found free. The reproductive organs of the lichen are of a
typically fungal character, <i>i.e.</i> are apothecia or perithecia
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Fungi</a></span>) and spermogonia. The algal cells are never
known to form spores while part of the lichen-thallus, but
they may do so when separated from it and growing free.
The fungus thus clearly takes the upper hand in the
association.</p>

<p>Owing to their peculiar dual nature, lichens are able to live
in situations where neither the alga nor fungus could exist alone.
The enclosed alga is protected by the threads (hyphae) of the
fungus, and supplied with water and salts and, possibly, organic
nitrogenous substances; in its turn the alga by means of its
green or blue-green colouring matter and the sun&rsquo;s energy
manufactures carbohydrates which are used in part by the
fungus. An association of two organisms to their mutual
advantage is known as <i>symbiosis</i>, and the lichen in botanical
language is described as a symbiotic union of an alga and a
fungus. This form of relationship is now known in other
groups of plants (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Bacteriology</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Fungi</a></span>), but it was
first discovered in the lichens. The lichens are characterized
by their excessively slow growth and their great length
of life.</p>

<p>Until comparatively recent times the lichens were considered
as a group of simple organisms on a level with algae and fungi.
The green (or blue-green) cells were termed gonidia by Wallroth,
who looked upon them as asexual reproductive cells, but when it
was later realized that they were not reproductive elements
they were considered as mere outgrowths of the hyphae of the
thallus which had developed chlorophyll. In 1865 De Bary
suggested the possibility that such lichens as <i>Collema</i>, <i>Ephebe</i>,
&amp;c., arose as a result of the attack of parasitic Ascomycetes upon
the algae, Nostoc, Chroococcus, &amp;c. In 1867 the observations
of Famintzin and Baranetzky showed that the gonidia, in certain
cases, were able to live outside the lichen-thallus, and in the case
of Physcia, Evernia and Cladonia were able to form zoospores.
Baranetzky therefore concluded that a certain number, if not
all of the so-called algae were nothing more than free living
lichen-gonidia. In 1869 Schwendener put forward the really
illuminating view&mdash;exactly opposite to that of Baranetzky&mdash;that
the gonidia in all cases were algae which had been attacked
by parasitic fungi. Although Schwendener supported this
view of the &ldquo;dual&rdquo; nature of lichens by very strong evidence
and identified the more common lichen-gonidia with known
free-living algae, yet the theory was received with a storm of
opposition by nearly all lichenologists. These workers were
unable to consider with equanimity the loss of the autonomy
of their group and its reduction to the level of a special
division of the fungi. The observations of Schwendener,
however, received ample support from Bornet&rsquo;s (1873) examination
of 60 genera. He investigated the exact relation of
fungus and alga and showed that the same alga is able to
combine with a number of different fungi to form lichens;
thus <i><span class="correction" title="amended from Chroolepns">Chroolepus</span> umbrinus</i> is found as the gonidia of 13 different
lichen genera.</p>

<p>The view of the dual nature of lichens had hitherto been
based on analysis; the final proof of this view was now supplied
by the actual <i>synthesis</i> of a lichen from fungal and algal constituents.
Rees in 1871 produced the sterile thallus of a <i>Collema</i>
from its constituents; later Stahl did the same for three species.
Later Bonnier (1886) succeeded in producing fertile thalli by
sowing lichen spores and the appropriate algae upon sterile
glass plates or portions of bark, and growing them in sterilized
air (fig. 1). Möller also in 1887 succeeded in growing small
lichen-thalli without their algal constituent (gonidia) on nutritive
solutions; in the case of <i>Calicium</i> pycnidia were actually
produced under these conditions.</p>

<p>The thallus or body of the lichen is of very different form in
different genera. In the simplest filamentous lichens (<i>e.g.</i> <i>Ephebe
pubescens</i>) the form of thallus is the form of the filamentous alga
which is merely surrounded by the fungal hyphae (fig. 2). The
next simplest forms are gelatinous lichens (<i>e.g.</i> <i>Collemaceae</i>); in
these the algae are Chroococcaceae and Nostocaceae, and the
fungus makes its way into the gelatinous membranes of the
algal cells and ramifies there (fig. 3). We can distinguish this class
of forms as lichens with a <i>homoiomerous</i> thallus, <i>i.e.</i> one in which
the alga and fungus are equally distributed. The majority of the
lichens, however, possess a stratified thallus in which the gonidia
are found as a definite layer or layers embedded in a pseudo-parenchymatous
mass of fungal hyphae, <i>i.e.</i> they are <i>heteromerous</i>
(figs. 8 and 9). Obviously these two conditions may merge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page579" id="page579"></a>579</span>
into one another, and the distinction is not of classificatory
value.</p>

<p class="pt2">In external form the heteromerous thallus presents the following
modifications. (<i>a</i>) The <i>foliaceous</i> (leaf-like) thallus, which may be
either peltate, <i>i.e.</i> rounded and entire, as in <i>Umbilicaria</i>, &amp;c., or
variously lobed and laciniated, as in <i>Sticta</i>, <i>Parmelia</i>, <i>Cetraria</i> (fig. 4),
&amp;c. This is the highest type of its development, and is sometimes very
considerably expanded. (<i>b</i>) The <i>fruticose</i> thallus may be either erect,
becoming pendulous, as in <i>Usnea</i> (fig. 5), <i>Ramalina</i>, &amp;c., or prostrate,
as in <i>Alectoria jubata</i>, var. <i>chalybeiformis</i>. It is usually divided into
branches and branchlets, bearing some resemblance to a miniature
shrub. An erect cylindrical thallus terminated by the fruit is termed
a <i>podetium</i>, as in <i>Cladonia</i> (fig. 7). (<i>c</i>) The <i>crustaceous</i> thallus, which
is the most common of all, forms a mere crust on the substratum,
varying in thickness, and may be squamose (in <i>Squamaria</i>), radiate
(in <i>Placodium</i>), areolate, granulose or pulverulent (in various
<i>Lecanorae</i> and <i>Lecideae</i>). (<i>d</i>) The <i>hypophloeodal</i> thallus is often
concealed beneath the bark of trees (as in some <i>Verrucariae</i> and
<i>Arthoniae</i>), or enters into the fibres of wood (as in <i>Xylographa</i> and
<i>Agyrium</i>), being indicated externally only by a very thin film
(figs. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8). In colour also the thallus externally is
very variable. In the dry and more typical state it is most frequently
white or whitish, and almost as often greyish or greyish
glaucous. Less commonly it is of different shades of brown, red,
yellow and black. In the moist state of the thallus these colours are
much less apparent, as the textures then become more or less translucent,
and the thallus usually prevents the greenish colour of the
gonidia (<i>e.g.</i> <i>Parmelia Borreri</i>, <i>Peltidea aphthosa</i>, <i>Umbilicaria
pustulata</i> and pulverulent <i>Lecideae</i>).</p>

<p>The thallus may be free upon the surface of the substratum (<i>e.g.</i>
<i>Collema</i>) or may be fixed more or less closely to it by special hyphae
or rhizoids. These may penetrate but slightly into the substratum,
but the connexion established may be so close that it is impossible
to remove the thallus from the substratum without injury (<i>e.g.</i>
<i>Physcia</i>, <i>Placodium</i>). In some cases the rhizoids are united together
into larger strands, the <i>rhizines</i>.</p>

<p>The typical heteromerous thallus shows on section a peripheral,
thin and therefore transparent, layer, the <i>cortical layer</i>, and centrally
a mass of denser tissue the so-called <i>medullary layer</i>, between these
two layers is the algal zone or gonidial layer (figs. 8 and 9).</p>

<p>The term <i>epithallus</i> is sometimes applied to the superficial dense
portion of the cortical layer and the term <i>hypothallus</i> to the layer,
when specially modified, in immediate contact with the substratum;
the hypothallus is usually dark or blackish. The cylindrical branches
of the fruticose forms are usually radially symmetrical, but the
flattened branches of these forms and also the thalli of the foliaceous
form show a difference in the cortex of the upper and lower side.
The cortical layer is usually more developed on the side towards the
light, while in many lichens this is the only side provided with a
cortical layer. The podetia of some species of Cladonia possess no
cortical layer at all. The surface of the thallus often exhibits outgrowths
in the form of warts, hairs, &amp;c. The medullary layer,
which usually forms the main part of the thallus, is distinguished
from the cortical layer by its looser consistence and the presence in
it of numerous, large, air-containing spaces.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Cephalodia</i>.&mdash;In about 100 species of lichens peculiar growths
are developed in the interior of the thallus which cause a slight
projection of the upper
or lower surface. These
structures are known as
<i>cephalodia</i> and they
usually occupy a definite
position in the thallus.
They are distinguished by
possessing as gonidia algae
foreign to the ordinary
part of the thallus. The
foreign algae are always
members of the Cyanophyceae
and on the same
individual and even in the
same cephalodium more
than one type of gonidium
may be found. The function
of these peculiar
structures is unknown.
Zukal has suggested that
they may play the part of
water-absorbing organs.</p>
</div>

<p>The exact relation of
gonidia and hyphae has
been investigated especially
by Bornet and
also by Hedlund, and very considerable differences have
been shown to exist in different genera. In <i>Physma</i>,
<i>Arnoldia</i>, <i>Phylliscum</i> and other genera the gonidia are
killed sooner or later by special hyphal branches, <i>haustoria</i>,
which pierce the membrane of the algal cell, penetrate the protoplasm
and absorb the contents (fig. 11, C). In other cases,
<i>e.g.</i> <i>Synalissa</i>, <i>Micarea</i>, the haustoria pierce the membrane,
but do not penetrate the protoplasm (fig. 11, D). In many
other cases, especially those algae possessing <i>Pleurococcus</i>
as their gonidia, there are no penetrating hyphae, but merely
special short hyphal branches which are in close contact with
the membrane of the algal cell (fig. 3).</p>

<p class="pt2 center"><i>Reproduction</i>.</p>

<p>There are three methods of reproduction of the lichen: by
fragmentation, by soredia, by the formation of fungal spores.
In the first process, portions of thallus containing gonidia may
be accidentally separated and so may start new plants. The
second method is only a special process of fragmentation. The
soredia are found in a large number of lichens, and consist
of a single gonidium or groups of gonidia, surrounded by a
sheath and hyphae. They arise usually in the gonidial layer
of the thallus by division of the gonidia and the development
around them of the hyphal investment; their increase in number
leads to the rupture of the enclosing cortical layer and the soredia
escape from the thallus as a powdery mass (fig. 12). Since
they are provided with both fungal and algal elements, they
are able to develop directly, under suitable conditions, into
a new thallus. The soredia are the most successful method
of reproduction in lichens, for not only are some forms nearly
always without spore-formation and in others the spores <span class="correction" title="amended from laregly">largely</span>
abortive, but in all cases the spore represents only the fungal
component of the thallus, and its success in the development
of a new lichen-thallus depends on the chance meeting, at the
time of germination, with the appropriate algal component.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Conidia</i>.&mdash;Contrary to the behaviour of the non-lichen forming
Ascomycetes the lichen-fungi show very few cases of ordinary
conidial formation. Bornet describes free conidia in <i>Arnoldia

described by Neubner in the Caliciae.</p>

<p class="pt2"><i>Spermatia</i>.&mdash;In the majority of genera of lichens small flask-shaped
structures are found embedded in the thallus (fig. 13). These were
investigated by Tulasne
in 1853, who gave them
the name <i>spermogonia</i>
The lower, ventral portion
of the spermogonium
is lined by
delicate hyphae, the
<i>sterigmata</i>, which give
origin to minute colourless
cells, the <i>spermatia</i>.
The sterigmata are
either simple (fig. 13, C)
or septate&mdash;the so-called
arthrosterigmata
(fig. 13, B). The spermogonia
open by a small
pore at the apex, towards
which the sterigmata
converge and
through which the spermatia
escape (fig. 13).
There are two views as
to the nature of the
spermatia. In one view
they are mere asexual
conidia, and the term
<i>pycnoconidia</i> is accordingly
applied since they
are borne in structures
like the non-sexual
<i>pycnidia</i> of other fungi.
In the other view the
spermatia are the male
sexual cells and thus
are rightly named; it
should, however, be
pointed out that this
was not the view of
Tulasne, though we owe
to him the designation
which carries with it
the sexual significance.
The question is one
very difficult to settle
owing to the fact that
the majority of spermatia
appear to be functionless. In favour of the conidial view is
the fact that in the case of <i>Collema</i> and a few other forms the spermatia
have been made to germinate in artificial cultures, and in the
case of <i>Calicium parietinum</i> Möfler succeeded in producing a spermogonia
bearing thallus from a spermatium. For the germination
of the spermatia in nature there is only the observation of Hedlund,
that in <i>Catillaria denigrata</i> and <i>C. prasena</i> a thallus may be derived
from the spermatia under natural conditions. In relation to the
view that the spermatia are sexual cells, or at least were primitively
so, it must be pointed out that although the actual fusion of the
spermatial nucleus with a female nucleus has not been observed,
yet in a few cases the spermatia have been seen to fuse with a
projecting portion (trichogyne) of the ascogonium, as in <i>Collema</i>
and <i>Physcia</i>, and there is very strong circumstantial evidence that
fertilization takes place (see later in section on development of
ascocarp). The resemblance of the spermatia and spermogonia to
those of Uredineae should be pointed out, where also there is considerable
evidence for their original sexual nature, though they appear in
that group to be functionless in all cases. The observations of Möller,
&amp;c., on the germination cannot be assumed to negative the sexual
hypothesis for the sexual cells of <i>Ulothrix</i> and <i>Ectocarpus</i>, for example
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page581" id="page581"></a>581</span>
are able to develop with or without fusion. The most satisfactory
view in the present state of our knowledge seems to be that the spermatia
are male cells which,
while retaining their fertilizing
action in a few cases are
now mainly functionless. The
female sexual organs, the
ascogonia, would thus in the
majority of cases develop by
the aid of some reduced
sexual process or the ascocarps
be developed without
relation to sexual organs.
A further argument in support
of this view is that it is
in complete agreement with
what we know of the sexuality
of the ordinary, free-living
ascomycetes, where we find
both normal and reduced
forms (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Fungi</a></span>).</p>

<p class="pt2"><i>Fruit Bodies.</i>&mdash;We find
two chief types of fruit
bodies in the lichens, the
<i>perithecium</i> and <i>apothecium</i>;
the first when the fungal
element is a member of the
Pyrenomycetes division of
the Ascomycetes, the second
when the fungus belongs to
the Discomycetes division.
In the two genera of lichens&mdash;the
<i>Basidiolichens</i>&mdash;in
which the fungus is a member
of the Basidiomycetes,
we have the fructification
characteristic of that class
of fungi: these are dealt with separately. The perithecium
is very constant in form and since the gonidia take no part
in the formation of this organ or that of the apothecium it
has the general structure characteristic of that division of
fungi. The apothecia, though of the normal fungal type and
usually disk-shaped, are somewhat more variable, and since the
variations are of value in classification some more details may
be added.</p>

<p class="pt2">The two principal parts of which an apothecium consists are the
<i>hypothecium</i> and the hymenium, or thecium. The
<i>hypothecium</i> is the basal part of the apothecium on
which the <i>hymenium</i> is borne; the latter consists of
asci (thecae) with ascospores, and paraphyses. The
paraphyses (which may be absent entirely in the
Pyrenolichens) are erect, colourless filaments which are
usually dilated and coloured at the apex; the apices
are usually cemented together into a definite layer, the
<i>epithecium</i> (fig. 14). The spores themselves may be
unicellular without a septum or multicellular with
one or more septa. Sometimes the two cavities are
restricted to the two ends of the spore, the <i>polari-bilocular</i>
type and the two loculi may be united
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page582" id="page582"></a>582</span>
by a narrow channel (fig. 15). At other times the spores are
divided by both transverse and longitudinal septa producing the
muriform (murali-divided) spore so called from the resemblance
of the individual chambers to the stones in a wall. The very large
single spores of <i>Pertusaria</i> have been shown to contain numerous
nuclei and when they germinate develop a large number of germ
tubes.</p>

<p><i>Development of the Ascocarps.</i>&mdash;As the remarks on the nature of
the spermatia show, the question of the sexuality of the lichens
has been hotly disputed in common with that of the rest of the
Ascomycetes. As indicated above, the weight of evidence seems to
favour what has been put forward in the case of the
non-lichen-forming fungi (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Fungi</a></span>), that in some cases the ascogonia develop
as a result of a previous fertilization by spermatia, in other cases
the ascogonia develop without such a union, while in still other
cases the reduction goes still farther and the ascogenous hyphae
instead of developing from the ascogonia are derived directly from
the vegetative hyphae.</p>

<p class="pt2">The first exact knowledge as to the origin of the ascocarp was the
work of Stahl on <i>Collema</i> in 1877. He showed that the archicarp
consisted of two parts, a lower coiled portion, the ascogonium, and
an upper portion, the trichogyne, which projected from the thallus.
Only when a spermatium was found attached to the trichogyne did
the further development of the ascogonium take place. From these
observations he drew the natural conclusion that the spermatium
was a male, sexual cell. This view was hotly contested by many
workers and it was sought to explain the trichogyne&mdash;without much
success&mdash;as a respiratory organ, or as a boring organ which made
a way for the developing
apothecium. It was not till
1898, however, that Stahl&rsquo;s
work received confirmation
and addition at the hands
of Baur (fig. 16). The latter
showed that in <i>Collema
crispum</i> there are two kinds
of thalli, one with numerous
apothecia, the other quite
sterile or bearing only a few.
The sterile thalli possessed
no spermogonia, but were
found to show sometimes
as many as 1000 archicarps
with trichogynes; yet none
or very few came to maturity.
The fertile thalli were shown
to bear either spermogonia
or to be in immediate connexion
with spermogonia-bearing
thalli. Furthermore
Baur showed that after the
fusion of the spermatium
with the trichogyne the
transverse walls of that
organ became perforated.
There was thus very strong circumstantial evidence in favour of
fertilization, although the male nucleus was not traced. The
further work of Baur, and that of Darbishire, Funfstuck and
Lindau, have shown that in a number of other cases trichogynes are
present. Thus ascogonia with trichogynes have been observed in
<i>Endocarpon</i>, <i>Collema</i>, <i>Pertusaria</i>, <i>Lecanora</i>, <i>Gyrophora</i>, <i>Parmelia</i>,
<i>Ramalina</i>, <i>Physcia</i>, <i>Anaptychia</i> and <i>Cladonia</i>. In <i>Nephroma</i>,
<i>Peltigera</i>, <i>Peltidea</i> and <i>Solorina</i> a cogonia without trichogynes have
been observed. In <i>Collema</i> and a form like <i>Xanthoria parietina</i> it is
probable that actual fertilization takes place, and possibly also in
some of the other forms. It is probable, however, that in the
majority of cases the ascogonia develop without normal fertilization,
as is necessarily the case where the ascogonia have no trichogynes
or the spermatia are absent. In these cases we should expect
to find some reduced process of fertilization similar to that of
<i>Humaria granulata</i> among the ordinary
Ascomycetes, where in the absence of
the antheridia the female nuclei fuse
in pairs. In other lichens we should
expect to find the ascogenous hyphae
arising directly from the vegetative
hyphae as in <i>Humaria rutilans</i> among
the ordinary fungi, where the process
is associated with the fusion of vegetative
nuclei. It is possible that <i>Solorina
saccata</i> belongs to this class.
Cytological details of nuclear behaviour
among the lichens are, however, difficult
to obtain owing to the slow growth of
these forms and the often refractory
nature of the material in the matter
of preparation for microscopical examination.</p>

<p><i>Ejection of Spores.</i>&mdash;The spores are
ejected from the apothecia and perithecia
as in the fungi by forcible ejaculation
from the asci. In the majority
of forms it is clear that the soredia
rather than the ascospore must play
the more important part in lichen distribution
as the development of the
ordinary spores is dependent on their
finding the proper alga on the substratum
on which they happen to fall.
In a number of forms (<i>Endocarpon
pusillum</i>, <i>Stigmaatonima cataleptum</i>,
various species of <i>Staurothele</i>), however,
there is a special arrangement by which
the spores are, on ejection, associated
with gonidia. In these forms gonidia are
found in connexion with the young
fruit; such algal cells undergo numerous
divisions becoming very small in size
and penetrating into the hymenium
among the asci and paraphyses. When
the spores are thrown out some of these
hymenial gonidia, as they are called, are
carried with them. When the spores
germinate the germ-tubes surround the algal cells, which now increase
in size and become the normal gonidia of the thallus.</p>

<p class="pt2 center" style="clear: both;"><i>Basidiolichens.</i></p>

<table class="flt" style="float: right; width: 350px;" summary="Illustration">

<p>As is clear from the above, nearly all the lichens are produced
by the association of an ascomycetous fungus with
algae. For some obscure reason the Basidiomycetes do not
readily form lichens, so that only a few forms are known in which
the fungal element is a member of this family. The two best-known
genera are <i>Cora</i>
and <i>Dictyonema</i>; <i>Corella</i>,
whose hymenium is unknown,
is also placed
here by Wainio. The
so-called Gasterolichens,
<i>Trichocoma</i> and <i>Emericella</i>,
have been shown
to be merely ascomycetous
fungi. <i>Clavaria
mucida</i>, however, has
apparently some claims
to be considered as a
Basidiolichen, since the
base of the fruit body
and the thallus from
which it arises, according
to Coker, always shows
a mixture of hyphae and
algae.</p>

<p>The best-known species is <i>Cora pavonia</i>, which is found in
tropical regions growing on the bare earth and on trees; the
gonidia belong to the genus <i>Chroococcus</i> while the fungus belongs,
apparently, to the Thelephoreae (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Fungi</a></span>). This lichen
seems unique in the fact that the fungal element is also found
growing and fruiting entirely devoid of algae, while in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page583" id="page583"></a>583</span>
ascolichens the fungus portion seems to have become so specialized
to its symbiotic mode of life that it is never found growing
independently.</p>

<p>The genus <i>Dictyonema</i> has gonidia belonging to the blue-green
alga, <i>Scytonema</i>. When the fungus predominates in
the thallus it has a bracket-like mode of growth and is found
projecting from the branches of trees with the hymenium on
the under side. When the alga is predominant it forms felted
patches on the bark of trees, the <i>Laudatea</i> form. It is said
that the fungus of <i>Cora pavonia</i> and of <i>Dictyonema</i> is identical,
the difference being in the nature of the alga.</p>

<p class="pt2 center"><i>Mode of Life.</i></p>

<p>Lichens are found growing in various situations such as
bare earth, the bark of trees, dead wood, the surface of stones
and rocks, where they have little competition to fear from
ordinary plants. As is well known, the lichens are often found
in the most exposed and arid situations; in the extreme polar
regions these plants are practically the only vegetable forms
of life. They owe their capacity to live under the most inhospitable
conditions to the dual nature of the organism, and to
their capacity to withstand extremes of heat, cold and drought
without destruction. On a bare rocky surface a fungus would
die from want of organic substance and an alga from drought
and want of mineral substances. The lichen, however, is
able to grow as the alga supplies organic food material and
the fungus has developed a battery of acids (see below) which
enable it actually to dissolve the most resistant rocks. It is
owing to the power of disintegrating by both mechanical and
chemical means the rocks on which they are growing that lichens
play such an important part in soil-production. The resistance
of lichens is extraordinary; they may be cooled to very low
temperatures and heated to high temperatures without being
killed. They may be dried so thoroughly that they can easily
be reduced to powder yet their vitality is not destroyed but
only suspended; on being supplied with water they absorb
it rapidly by their general surface and renew their activity. The
life of many lichens thus consists of alternating periods of
activity when moisture is plentiful, and completely suspended
animation under conditions of dryness. Though so little sensitive
to drought and extremes of temperature lichens appear to be
very easily affected by the presence in the air of noxious substances
such as are found in large cities or manufacturing
towns. In such districts lichen vegetation is entirely or almost
entirely absent. The growth of lichens is extremely slow and
many of them take years before they arrive at a spore-bearing
stage. <i>Xanthoria parietina</i> has been known to grow for forty-five
years before bearing apothecia. This slowness of growth
is associated with great length of life and it is probable that
individuals found growing on hard mountain rocks or on the
trunks of aged trees are many hundreds of years old. It is
possible that specimens of such long-lived species as <i>Lecidea
geographica</i> actually outrival in longevity the oldest trees.</p>

<p class="pt2 center"><i>Relation of Fungus and Alga.</i></p>

<p>The relation of the two constituents of the lichen have been
briefly stated in the beginning of this article. The relation of
the fungus to the alga, though it may be described in general
terms as one of symbiosis, partakes also somewhat of the nature
of parasitism. The algal cells are usually controlled in their
growth by the hyphae and are prevented from forming zoospores,
and in some cases, as already described, the algal cells are killed
sooner or later by the fungus. The fungus seems, on the other
hand, to stimulate the algal cells to special development, for those
in the lichen are larger than those in the free state, but this is
not necessarily adverse to the idea of parasitism, for it is well
known that an increase in the size of the cells of the host is
often the result of the attacks of parasitic fungi. It must be
borne in mind that the exact nutritive relations of the two
constituents of the lichen have not been completely elucidated,
and that it is very difficult to draw the line between symbiosis
and parasitism. The lichen algae are not alone in their specialization
to the symbiotic (or parasitic) mode of life, for, as stated
earlier, the fungus appear in the majority of cases to have completely
lost the power of independent development since with
very rare exceptions they are not found alone. They also differ
very markedly from free living fungi in their chemical reactions.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p class="pt2 center"><i>Chemistry of Lichens.</i></p>

<p>The chemistry of lichens is very complex, not yet fully investigated
and can only be very briefly dealt with here. The wall of the
hyphae of the fungus give in the young state the ordinary reactions
of cellulose but older material shows somewhat different reactions,
similar to those of the so-called fungus-cellulose. In many lichen-fungi
the wall shows various chemical modifications. In numerous
lichens, <i>e.g.</i> <i>Cetraria islandica</i>, the wall contains Lichenin (C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">10</span>O<span class="su">5</span>),
a gummy substance which swells in cold water and dissolves in hot.
Besides this substance, a very similar one, Isolichenin, is also found
which is distinguished from lichenin by the fact that it dissolves in
cold water and turns blue under the reaction of Iodine. Calcium
oxalate is a very common substance, especially in crustaceous
lichens; fatty oil in the form of drops or as an infiltration in the
membrane is also common; it sometimes occurs in special cells
and in extreme cases may represent 90% of the dry substance as
in <i>Verrucaria calciseda</i>, <i>Biatora immersa</i>.</p>

<p><i>Colouring Matters.</i>&mdash;Many lichens, as is well known, exhibit a vivid
colouring which is usually due to the incrustation of the hyphae
with crystalline excretory products. These excretory products
have usually an acid nature and hence are generally known as
lichen-acids. A large number of these acids, which are mostly
benzene derivatives, have been isolated and more or less closely
investigated. They are characterized by their insolubility or very
slight solubility in water; as examples may be mentioned erythrinic
acid in <i>Roccella</i> and <i>Lecanora</i>; evernic acid in species of <i>Evernia</i>,
<i>Ramalina</i> and <i>Cladonia</i>; lecanoric acid in <i>Lecanora</i>, <i>Gyrophora</i>.
The so-called chrysophanic acid found in <i>Xanthoria</i> (Physcia)
<i>parietina</i> is not an acid but a quinone and is better termed physcion.</p>

<p><i>Colour Reactions of Lichens.</i>&mdash;The classification of lichens is unique
in the fact that chemical colour reactions are used by many lichenologists
in the discrimination of species, and these reactions are
included in the specific diagnoses. The substances used as tests in
these reactions are caustic potash and calcium hypochlorite; the
former being the substance dissolved in an equal weight of water
and the latter a saturated extract of bleaching powder in water.
These substances are represented by lichenologists by the signs K
and CaCl respectively, and the presence or absence of the colour
reactions are represented thus, K+, CaCl+, or K&minus;, CaCl&minus;. If
the cortical layer should exhibit positive reaction and the medulla
of the same species a negative reaction with both reagents, the
result is represented thus, K±CaCl±. If a reaction is only
produced after the consecutive addition of the two reagents, this
is symbolized by K(CaCl)+. A solution of iodine is also used as a
test owing to the blue or wine-red colour which the thallus, hymenium
or spores may give with this reagent. The objection to the case of
these colour reactions is due to the indefinite nature of the reaction
and the doubt as to the constant presence of a definite chemical
compound in a given species. A yellow colour with caustic potash
solution is produced not only by atranoric acid but also by evernic
acid, thamnolic acid, &amp;c. Again in the case of <i>Xanthoria parietina</i>
vulpinic acid is only to be found in young thalli growing on sandstone;
in older forms or in those growing on another substratum
it is not to be detected. A similar relation between oil formation
and the nature of the substratum has been observed in many lichens.
Considerations such as these should make one very wary in placing
reliance on these colour reactions for the purposes of classification.</p>
</div>

<p class="pt2 center"><i>Economic Uses of Lichens.</i></p>

<p>In the arts, as food and as medicine, many lichens have been
highly esteemed, though others are not now employed for the
same purposes as formerly.</p>

<p>1. <i>Lichens Used in the Arts.</i>&mdash;Of these the most important are
such as yield, by maceration in ammonia, the dyes known in
commerce as archil, cudbear and litmus. These, however, may
with propriety be regarded as but different names for the same
pigmentary substance, the variations in the character of which
are attributable to the different modes in which the pigments
are manufactured. Archil proper is derived from several species
of <i>Roccella</i> (<i>e.g.</i> <i>R. Montaguei</i>, <i>R. tinctoria</i>), which yield a rich
purple dye; it once fetched a high price in the market. Of
considerable value is the &ldquo;perelle&rdquo; prepared from <i>Lecanora
parella</i>, and used in the preparation of a red or crimson dye.
Inferior to this is &ldquo;cudbear,&rdquo; derived from <i>Lecanora tartarea</i>,
which was formerly very extensively employed by the peasantry
of north Europe for giving a scarlet or purple colour to woollen
cloths. By adding certain alkalies to the other ingredients used
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page584" id="page584"></a>584</span>
in the preparation of these pigments, the colour becomes indigo-blue,
in which case it is the litmus of the Dutch manufacturers.
Amongst other lichens affording red, purple or brown dyes may
be mentioned <i>Ramalina scopulorum</i>, <i>Parmelia</i>, <i>saxatilis</i> and
<i>P. amphalodes</i>, <i>Umbilicaria pustulata</i> and several species of
<i>Gyrophora</i>, <i>Urceolaria scruposa</i>, all of which are more or less
employed as domestic dyes. Yellow dyes, again, are derived
from <i>Chlorea vulpina</i>, <i>Platysma juniperinum</i>, <i>Parmelia caperata</i>
and <i>P. conspersa</i>, <i>Physcia flavicans</i>, <i>Ph. parietina</i> and <i>Ph.
lychnea</i>, though like the preceding they do not form articles
of commerce, being merely used locally by the natives of the
regions in which they occur most plentifully. In addition to
these, many exotic lichens, belonging especially to <i>Parmelia</i> and
<i>Sticta</i> (<i>e.g.</i> <i>Parmelia tinctorum</i>, <i>Sticta argyracea</i>), are rich in
colouring matter, and, if obtained in sufficient quantity, would
yield a dye in every way equal to archil. These pigments
primarily depend upon special acids contained in the thalli of
lichens, and their presence may readily be detected by means of
the reagents already noticed. In the process of manufacture,
however, they undergo various changes, of which the chemistry
is still but little understood. At one time also some species
were used in the arts for supplying a gum as a substitute for
gum-arabic. These were chiefly <i>Ramalina fraxinea</i>, <i>Evernia
prunastri</i> and <i>Parmelia physodes</i>, all of which contain a considerable
proportion of gummy matter (of a much inferior quality,
however, to gum-arabic), and were employed in the process of
calico-printing and in the making of parchment and cardboard.
In the 17th century some filamentose and fruticulose lichens,
viz. species of <i>Usnea</i> and <i>Ramalina</i>, also <i>Evernia furfuracea</i> and
<i>Cladonia rangiferina</i>, were used in the art of perfumery. From
their supposed aptitude to imbibe and retain odours, their
powder was the basis of various perfumes, such as the celebrated
&ldquo;Poudre de Cypre&rdquo; of the hairdressers, but their employment
in this respect has long since been abandoned.</p>

<p>2. <i>Nutritive Lichens.</i>&mdash;Of still greater importance is the
capacity of many species for supplying food for man and beast.
This results from their containing starchy substances, and in
some cases a small quantity of saccharine matter of the nature of
mannite. One of the most useful nutritious species is <i>Cetraria
islandica</i>, &ldquo;Iceland moss,&rdquo; which, after being deprived of its
bitterness by boiling in water, is reduced to a powder and made
into cakes, or is boiled and eaten with milk by the poor Icelander,
whose sole food it often constitutes. Similarly <i>Cladonia rangiferina</i>
and <i>Cl. sylvatica</i>, the familiar &ldquo;reindeer moss,&rdquo; are
frequently eaten by man in times of scarcity, after being powdered
and mixed with flour. Their chief importance, however, is that
in Lapland and other northern countries they supply the winter
food of the reindeer and other animals, who scrape away the snow
and eagerly feed upon them. Another nutritious lichen is the
&ldquo;Tripe de Roche&rdquo; of the arctic regions, consisting of several
species of the <i>Gyrophorei</i>, which when boiled is often eaten by
the Canadian hunters and Red Indians when pressed by hunger.
But the most singular esculent lichen of all is the &ldquo;manna lichen,&rdquo;
which in times of drought and famine has served as food for large
numbers of men and cattle in the arid steppes of various countries
stretching from Algiers to Tartary. This is derived chiefly
from <i>Lecanora esculenta</i>, which grows unattached on the ground
in layers from 3 to 6 in. thick over large tracts of country in
the form of small irregular lumps of a greyish or white colour.
In connexion with their use as food we may observe that of
recent years in Scandinavia and Russia an alcoholic spirit has
been distilled from <i>Cladonia rangiferina</i> and extensively consumed,
especially in seasons when potatoes were scarce and
dear. Formerly also <i>Sticta pulmonaria</i> was much employed in
brewing instead of hops, and it is said that a Siberian monastery
was much celebrated for its beer which was flavoured with the
bitter principle of this species.</p>

<p>3. <i>Medicinal Lichens.</i>&mdash;During the middle ages, and even in
some quarters to a much later period, lichens were extensively
used in medicine in various European countries. Many species
had a great repute as demulcents, febrifuges, astringents, tonics,
purgatives and anthelmintics. The chief of those employed
for one or other, and in some cases for several, of these purposes
were <i>Cladonia pyxidata</i>, <i>Usnea barbata</i>, <i>Ramalina farinacea</i>,
<i>Evernia prunastri</i>, <i>Cetraria ìslandica</i>, <i>Sticla pulmonaria</i>,
<i>Parmelia saxatilis</i>, <i>Xanthoria parietina</i> and <i>Pertusaria amara</i>.
Others again were believed to be endowed with specific virtues,
<i>e.g.</i> <i>Peltigera canina</i>, which formed the basis of the celebrated
&ldquo;pulvis antilyssus&rdquo; of Dr Mead, long regarded as a sovereign
cure for hydrophobia; <i>Platysma juniperinum</i>, lauded as a specific
in jaundice, no doubt on the <i>similia similibus</i> principle from a
resemblance between its yellow colour and that of the jaundiced
skin; <i>Peltidea aphthosa</i>, which on the same principle was regarded
by the Swedes, when boiled in milk, as an effectual remedy for
the <i>aphthae</i> or rash on their children. Almost all of these virtues,
general or specific, were imaginary; and at the present day,
except perhaps in some remoter districts of northern Europe,
only one of them is employed as a remedial agent. This is the
&ldquo;Iceland moss&rdquo; of the druggists&rsquo; shops, which is undoubtedly
an excellent demulcent in various dyspeptic and chest complaints.
No lichen is known to be possessed of any poisonous properties
to man, although <i>Chlorea vulpina</i> is believed by the Swedes to
be so. Zukal has considered that the lichen acids protect the
lichen from the attacks of animals; the experiments of Zopf,
however, have cast doubt on this; certainly lichens containing
very bitter acids are eaten by mites though some of the acids
appear to be poisonous to frogs.</p>

<p class="pt2 center"><i>Classification.</i></p>

<p>The dual nature of the lichen thallus introduces at the outset
a classificatory difficulty. Theoretically the lichens may be
classified on the basis of their algal constituent, on the basis of
their fungal constituent, or they may be classified as if they were
homogeneous organisms. The first of these systems is impracticable
owing to the absence of algal reproductive organs and the
similarity of the algal cells (gonidia) in a large number of different
forms. The second system is the most obvious one, since the
fungus is the dominant partner and produces reproductive
organs. The third system was that of Nylander and his followers,
who did not accept the Schwenderian doctrine of duality. In
actual practice the difference between the second and third
methods is not very great since the fungus is the producer of the
reproductive organs and generally the main constituent. Most
systems agree in deriving the major divisions from the characters
of the reproductive organs (perithecia, apothecia, or basidiospore
bearing fructification), while the characters of the algal cells
and those of the thallus generally are used for the minor divisions.
The difference between the various systems lies in the relative
importance given to the reproductive characters on the one hand
and the vegetative characters on the other. In the system
(1854-1855) of Nylander the greater weight is given to the latter,
while in more modern systems the former characters receive
the more attention.</p>

<p>A brief outline of a system of classification, mainly that of
Zahlbruckner as given in Engler and Prantl&rsquo;s <i>Pflanzenfamilien</i>,
is outlined below.</p>

<p>There are two main divisions of lichens, <i>Ascolichenes</i> and
<i>Basidiolichenes</i>, according to the nature of the fungal element,
whether an ascomycete or basidiomycete. The Ascolichenes
are again divided into <i>Pyrenocarpeae</i> or <i>Pyrenolichenes</i> and
<i>Gymnocarpeae</i> or <i>Discolichenes</i>; the first having an ascocarp
of the nature of a perithecium, the second bearing their ascospores
in an open apothecium.</p>

<p class="pt2 center"><i>Habitats and Distribution of Lichens.</i></p>

<p>1. <i>Habitats.</i>&mdash;These are extremely varied, and comprise
a great number of very different substrata. Chiefly, however,
they are the bark of trees, rocks, the ground, mosses and, rarely,
perennial leaves. (<i>a</i>) With respect to <i>corticolous</i> lichens, some
prefer the rugged bark of old trees (<i>e.g.</i> <i>Ramalina</i>, <i>Parmelia</i>,
<i>Stictei</i>) and others the smooth bark of young trees and shrubs
(<i>e.g.</i> <i>Graphidei</i> and some <i>Lecideae</i>). Many are found principally
in large forests (<i>e.g.</i> <i>Usnea</i>, <i>Alectoria jubata</i>); while a few occur
more especially on trees by roadsides (<i>e.g.</i> <i>Physcia parietina</i> and
<i>Ph. pulverulenta</i>). In connexion with corticolous lichens may
be mentioned those <i>lignicole</i> species which grow on decayed,
or decaying wood of trees and on old pales (<i>e.g.</i> <i>Caliciei</i>, various
<i>Lecideae</i>, <i>Xylographa</i>), (<i>b</i>) As to <i>saxicolous</i> lichens, which occur
on rocks and stones, they may be divided into two sections,
viz. <i>calcicolous</i> and <i>calcifugous</i>. To the former belong such as
are found on calcareous and cretaceous rocks, and the mortar
of walls (<i>e.g.</i> <i>Lecanora calcarea</i>, <i>Lecidea calcivora</i> and several
<i>Verrucariae</i>), while all other saxicolous lichens may be regarded
as belonging to the latter, whatever may be the mineralogical
character of the substratum. It is here worthy of notice that
the apothecia of several calcicolous lichens (<i>e.g.</i> <i>Lecanora
Prevostii</i>, <i>Lecidea calcivora</i>) have the power of forming minute
cavities in the rock, in which they are partially buried. (<i>c</i>)
With respect to terrestrial species, some prefer peaty soil (<i>e.g.</i>
<i>Cladonia</i>, <i>Lecidea decolorans</i>), others calcareous soil (<i>e.g.</i> <i>Lecanora
crassa</i>, <i>Lecidea decipiens</i>), others sandy soil or hardened mud
(<i>e.g.</i> <i>Collema limosum</i>, <i>Peltidea venosa</i>); while many may be
found growing on all kinds of soil, from the sands of the sea-shore
to the granitic detritus of lofty mountains, with the exception
of course of cultivated ground, there being no agrarian lichens.
(<i>d</i>) <i>Muscicolous</i> lichens again are such as are most frequently
met with on decayed mosses and <i>Jungermannia</i>, whether on
the ground, trees or rocks (<i>e.g.</i> <i>Leptogium muscicola</i>, <i>Gomphillus
calicioides</i>). (<i>e</i>) The <i>epiphyllous</i> species are very peculiar as
occurring upon perennial leaves of certain trees and shrubs,
whose vitality is not at all affected by their presence as it is by
that of fungi. In so far, however, as is known, they are very
limited in number (<i>e.g.</i> <i>Lecidea</i>, <i>Bouteillei</i>, <i>Strigula</i>).</p>

<p>Sometimes various lichens occur abnormally in such unexpected
habitats as dried dung of sheep, bleached bones of
reindeer and whales, old leather, iron and glass, in districts
where the species are abundant. It is apparent that in many
cases lichens are quite indifferent to the substrata on which
they occur, whence we infer that the preference of several for
certain substrata depends upon the temperature of the locality
or that of the special habitat. Thus in the case of saxicolous
lichens the mineralogical character of the rock has of itself little
or no influence upon lichen growth, which is influenced more
especially and directly by their physical properties, such as their
capacity for retaining heat and moisture. As a rule lichens
grow commonly in open exposed habitats, though some are
found only or chiefly in shady situations; while, as already
observed, scarcely any occur where the atmosphere is impregnated
with smoke. Many species also prefer growing in moist
places by streams, lakes and the sea, though very few are normally
and probably none entirely, <i>aquatic</i>, being always at certain
seasons exposed for a longer or shorter period to the atmosphere
(<i>e.g.</i> <i>Lichina</i>, <i>Leptogium rivulare</i>, <i>Endocarpon fluviatile</i>, <i>Verrucaria
maura</i>). Some species are entirely parasitical on other lichens
(<i>e.g.</i> various <i>Lecideae</i> and <i>Pyrenocarpei</i>), and may be peculiar
to one (<i>e.g.</i> <i>Lecidea vitellinaria</i>) or common to several species
(<i>e.g.</i> <i>Habrothallus parmeliarum</i>). A few, generally known as
<i>erratic</i> species, have been met with growing unattached to any
substratum (<i>e.g.</i> <i>Parmella revoluta</i>, var. <i>concentrica</i>, <i>Lecanora
esculenta</i>); but it can hardly be that these are really free <i>ab
initio</i> (<i>vide</i> Crombie in <i>Journ. Bot.</i>, 1872, p. 306). It is to the
different characters of the stations they occupy with respect
to exposure, moisture, &amp;c., that the variability observed in
many types of lichens is to be attributed.</p>

<p>2. <i>Distribution.</i>&mdash;From what has now been said it will readily
be inferred that the distribution of lichens over the surface of
the globe is regulated, not only by the presence of suitable
substrata, but more especially by climatic conditions. At the
same time it may safely be affirmed that their geographical range
is more extended than that of any other class of plants, occurring
as they do in the coldest and warmest regions&mdash;on the dreary
shores of arctic and antarctic seas and in the torrid valleys of
tropical climes, as well as on the greatest mountain elevations
yet attained by man, on projecting rocks even far above the snowline
(<i>e.g.</i> <i>Lecidea geographica</i>). In arctic regions lichens form by
far the largest portion of the vegetation, occurring everywhere
on the ground and on rocks, and fruiting freely; while terrestrial
species of <i>Cladonia</i> and <i>Stereocaulon</i> are seen in the greatest
luxuriance and abundance spreading over extensive tracts
almost to the entire exclusion of other vegetation. The lichen
flora of temperate regions again is essentially distinguished
from the preceding by the frequency of corticolous species
belonging to <i>Lecanora</i>, <i>Lecidea</i> and <i>Graphidei</i>. In intertropical
regions lichens attain their maximum development (and beauty)
in the foliaceous <i>Stictei</i> and <i>Parmeliei</i>, while they are especially
characterized by epiphyllous species, as <i>Strigula</i>, and by many
peculiar corticole <i>Thelotremei</i>, <i>Graphidei</i> and <i>Pyrenocarpei</i>.
Some lichens, especially saxicolous ones, seem to be cosmopolitan
(<i>e.g.</i> <i>Lecanora subfusca</i>, <i>Cladonia pyxidata</i>); and others, not
strictly cosmopolitan, have been observed in regions widely
apart. A considerable number of species, European and exotic,
seem to be <i>endemic</i>, but further research will no doubt show that
most of them occur in other climatic regions similar to those in
which they have hitherto alone been detected. To give any
detailed account, however, of the distribution of the different
genera (not to speak of that of individual species) of lichens
would necessarily far exceed available limits.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LICHFIELD,<a name="ar98" id="ar98"></a></span> a city, county of a city, and municipal borough
in the Lichfield parliamentary division of Staffordshire, England,
118 m. N.W. from London. Pop. (1901) 7902. The London
and North-Western railway has stations at Trent Valley Junction
on the main line, and in the city on a branch westward. The town
lies in a pleasant country, on a small stream draining eastward
to the Trent, with low hills to the E. and S. The cathedral is
small (the full internal length is only 370 ft., and the breadth
of the nave 68 ft.), but beautiful in both situation and style.
It stands near a picturesque sheet of water named Minster Pool.
The present building dates from various periods in the 13th and
early 14th centuries, but the various portions cannot be allocated
to fixed years, as the old archives were destroyed during the
Civil Wars of the 17th century. The earlier records of the church
are equally doubtful. A Saxon church founded by St Chad, who
was subsequently enshrined here, occupied the site from the
close of the 7th century; of its Norman successor portions of
the foundations have been excavated, but no record exists
either of its date or of its builders. The fine exterior of the
cathedral exhibits the feature, unique in England, of a lofty
central and two lesser western spires, of which the central,
252 ft. high, is a restoration attributed to Sir Christopher Wren
after its destruction during the Civil Wars. The west front is
composed of three stages of ornate arcading, with niches containing
statues, of which most are modern. Within, the south
transept shows simple Early English work, the north transept
and chapter house more ornate work of a later period in that
style, the nave, with its geometrical ornament, marks the
transition to the Decorated style, while the Lady chapel is a
beautiful specimen of fully developed Decorated work with an
apsidal east end. The west front probably falls in date between
the nave and the Lady chapel. Among numerous monuments
are&mdash;memorials to Samuel Johnson, a native of Lichfield, and
to David Garrick, who spent his early life and was educated here;
a monument to Major Hodson, who fell in the Indian mutiny,
and whose father was canon of Lichfield; the tomb of Bishop
Hacket, who restored the cathedral after the Civil Wars; and a
remarkable effigy of Perpendicular date displaying Sir John
Stanley stripped to the waist and awaiting chastisement. Here
is also the &ldquo;Sleeping Children,&rdquo; a masterpiece by Chantrey (1817).</p>

<p>A picturesque bishop&rsquo;s palace (1687) and a theological college
(1857) are adjacent to the cathedral. The diocese covers the
greater part of Staffordshire and about half the parishes in
Shropshire, with small portions of Cheshire and Derbyshire.
The church of St Chad is ancient though extensively restored;
on its site St Chad is said to have occupied a hermit&rsquo;s cell. The
principal schools are those of King Edward and St Chad. There
are many picturesque half-timbered and other old houses, among
which is that in which Johnson was born, which stands in the
market-place, and is the property of the corporation and opened
to the public. There is also in the market place a statue to
Johnson. A fair is held annually on Whit-Monday, accompanied
by a pageant of ancient origin. Brewing is the principal industry,
and in the neighbourhood are large market gardens. The city
is governed by a mayor, 6 aldermen and 18 councillors. Area,
3475 acres.</p>

<p>There is a tradition that &ldquo;Christianfield&rdquo; near Lichfield was
the site of the martyrdom of a thousand Christians during the
persecutions of Maximian about 286, but there is no evidence in
support of the tradition. At Wall, 3 m. from the present city,
there was a Romano-British village called Letocetum (&ldquo;grey
wood&rdquo;), from which the first half of the name Lichfield is
derived. The first authentic notice of Lichfield (<i>Lyecidfelth</i>,
<i>Lychfeld</i>, <i>Litchfield</i>) occurs in Bede&rsquo;s history where it is mentioned
as the place where St Chad fixed the episcopal see of the Mercians.
After the foundation of the see by St Chad in 669, it was raised in
786 by Pope Adrian through the influence of Offa, King of
Mercia, to the dignity of an archbishopric, but in 803 the primacy
was restored to Canterbury. In 1075 the see of Lichfield was
removed to Chester, and thence a few years later to Coventry,
but it was restored in 1148. At the time of the Domesday
Survey Lichfield was held by the bishop of Chester: it is not
called a borough, and it was a small village, whence, on account
of its insignificance, the see had been moved. The lordship and
manor of the town were held by the bishop until the reign of
Edward VI., when they were leased to the corporation. There
is evidence that a castle existed here in the time of Bishop Roger
Clinton (<i>temp.</i> Henry I.), and a footpath near the grammar-school
retains the name of Castle-ditch. Richard II. gave a
charter (1387) for the foundation of the gild of St Mary and St
John the Baptist; this gild obtained the whole local government,
which it exercised until its dissolution by Edward VI., who
incorporated the town (1548), vesting the government in two
bailiffs and twenty-four burgesses; further charters were given
by Mary, James I. and Charles II. (1664), the last, incorporating
it under the title of the &ldquo;bailiffs and citizens of the city of Lichfield,&rdquo;
was the governing charter until 1835; under this charter
the governing body consisted of two bailiffs and twenty-four
brethren. Lichfield sent two members to the parliament of 1304
and to a few succeeding parliaments, but the representation did
not become regular until 1552; in 1867 it lost one member, and
in 1885 its representation was merged in that of the county.
By the charter of James I. the market day was changed from
Wednesday to Tuesday and Friday; the Tuesday market
disappeared during the 19th century; the only existing fair is a
small pleasure fair of ancient origin held on Ash-Wednesday;
the annual fête on Whit-Monday claims to date from the time
of Alfred. In the Civil Wars Lichfield was divided. The
cathedral authorities with a certain following were for the
king, but the townsfolk generally sided with the parliament,
and this led to the fortification of the close in 1643. Lord Brooke,
notorious for his hostility to the church, came against it, but
was killed by a deflected bullet on St Chad&rsquo;s day, an accident
welcomed as a miracle by the Royalists. The close yielded and
was retaken by Prince Rupert in this year; but on the breakdown
of the king&rsquo;s cause in 1646 it again surrendered. The
cathedral suffered terrible damage in these years.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LICH-GATE,<a name="ar99" id="ar99"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Lych-gate</span> (from O. Eng. <i>lic</i> &ldquo;a body, a
corpse&rdquo;; cf. Ger. <i>Leiche</i>), the roofed-in gateway or porch-entrance
to churchyards. Lich-gates existed in England certainly thirteen
centuries ago, but comparatively few early ones survive, as they
were almost always of wood. One at Bray, Berkshire, is dated
1448. Here the clergy meet the corpse and some portion of
the service is read. The gateway was really part of the church;
it also served to shelter the pall-bearers while the bier was
brought from the church. In some lich-gates there stood large
flat stones called lich-stones upon which the corpse, usually
uncoffined, was laid. The most common form of lich-gate is a
simple shed composed of a roof with two gabled ends, covered
with tiles or thatch. At Berrynarbor, Devon, there is a lich-gate
in the form of a cross, while at Troutbeck, Westmorland, there
are three lich-gates to one churchyard. Some elaborate gates
have chambers over them. The word <i>lich</i> entered into composition
constantly in old English, thus, lich-bell, the hand-bell
rung before a corpse; lich-way, the path along which a corpse
was carried to burial (this in some districts was supposed to
establish a right-of-way); lich-owl, the screech-owl, because its
cry was a portent of death; and lyke-wake, a night watch over
a corpse.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LICHTENBERG, GEORG CHRISTOPH<a name="ar100" id="ar100"></a></span> (1742-1799), German
physicist and satirical writer, was born at Oberramstadt, near
Darmstadt, on the 1st of July 1742. In 1763 he entered Göttingen
university, where in 1769 he became extraordinary professor of
physics, and six years later ordinary professor. This post he
held till his death on the 24th of February 1799. As a physicist
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page587" id="page587"></a>587</span>
he is best known for his investigations in electricity, more
especially as to the so-called Lichtenberg figures, which are
fully described in two memoirs <i>Super nova methodo motum ac
naturam fluidi electrici investigandi</i> (Göttingen, 1777-1778).
These figures, originally studied on account of the light they
were supposed to throw on the nature of the electric fluid or
fluids, have reference to the distribution of electricity over
the surface of non-conductors. They are produced as follows:
A sharp-pointed needle is placed perpendicular to a non-conducting
plate, such as of resin, ebonite or glass, with its point
very near to or in contact with the plate, and a Leyden jar is
discharged into the needle. The electrification of the plate is
now tested by sifting over it a mixture of flowers of sulphur
and red lead. The negatively electrified sulphur is seen to attach
itself to the positively electrified parts of the plate, and the
positively electrified red lead to the negatively electrified parts.
In addition to the distribution of colour thereby produced, there
is a marked difference in the <i>form</i> of the figure, according to the
nature of the electricity originally communicated to the plate.
If it be positive, a widely extending patch is seen on the plate,
consisting of a dense nucleus, from which branches radiate in
all directions; if negative the patch is much smaller and has a
sharp circular boundary entirely devoid of branches. If the plate
receives a mixed charge, as, for example, from an induction
coil, a &ldquo;mixed&rdquo; figure results, consisting of a large red central
nucleus, corresponding to the negative charge, surrounded by
yellow rays, corresponding to the positive charge. The difference
between the positive and negative figures seems to depend
on the presence of the air; for the difference tends to disappear
when the experiment is conducted in vacuo. Riess explains it
by the negative electrification of the plate caused by the friction
of the water vapour, &amp;c., driven along the surface by the explosion
which accompanies the disruptive discharge at the point. This
electrification would favour the spread of a positive, but hinder
that of a negative discharge. There is, in all probability, a
connexion between this phenomenon and the peculiarities of
positive and negative brush and other discharge in air.</p>

<p>As a satirist and humorist Lichtenberg takes high rank among
the German writers of the 18th century. His biting wit involved
him in many controversies with well-known contemporaries,
such as Lavater, whose science of physiognomy he ridiculed,
and Voss, whose views on Greek pronunciation called forth a
powerful satire, <i>Über die Pronunciation der Schöpse des alten
Griechenlandes</i> (1782). In 1769 and again in 1774 he resided for
some time in England and his <i>Briefe aus England</i> (1776-1778),
with admirable descriptions of Garrick&rsquo;s acting, are the most
attractive of his writings. He contributed to the <i>Göttinger
Taschenkalender</i> from 1778 onwards, and to the <i>Göttingisches
Magazin der Literatur und Wissenschaft</i>, which he edited for
three years (1780-1782) with J. G. A. Forster. He also published
in 1794-1799 an <i>Ausführliche Erklärung der Hogarthschen
Kupferstiche</i>.</p>

the west bank of the Rhine, enclosed by the Nahe, the Blies

Prussian Rhine province. The principality was constructed of
parts of the electorate of Trier, of Nassau-Saarbrücken and other
districts, and lay between Rhenish Bavaria and the old Prussian
province of the Rhine. Originally called the lordship of Baumholder,
it owed the name of Lichtenberg and its elevation in
1819 to a principality to Ernest, duke of Saxe-Coburg, to whom
it was ceded by Prussia, in 1816, in accordance with terms
agreed upon at the congress of Vienna. The duke, however,

emperor, <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 307-324, of Illyrian peasant origin, was born
probably about 250. After the death of Flavius Valerius
Severus he was elevated to the rank of Augustus by Galerius,
his former friend and companion in arms, on the 11th of November
307, receiving as his immediate command the provinces of
Illyricum. On the death of Galerius, in May 311, he shared the
entire empire with Maximinus, the Hellespont and the Thracian
Bosporus being the dividing line. In March 313 he married
Constantia, half-sister of Constantine, at Mediolanum (Milan),
in the following month inflicted a decisive defeat on Maximinus
at Heraclea Pontica, and established himself master of the
East, while his brother-in-law, Constantine, was supreme in
the West. In 314 his jealousy led him to encourage a treasonable
enterprise on the part of Bassianus against Constantine. When
his perfidy became known a civil war ensued, in which he was
twice severely defeated&mdash;first near Cibalae in Pannonia (October
8th, 314), and next in the plain of Mardia in Thrace; the outward
reconciliation, which was effected in the following December,
left Licinius in possession of Thrace, Asia Minor, Syria and
Egypt, but added numerous provinces to the Western empire.
In 323 Constantine, tempted by the &ldquo;advanced age and unpopular
vices&rdquo; of his colleague, again declared war against him,
and, having defeated his army at Adrianople (3rd of July 323),
succeeded in shutting him up within the walls of Byzantium.
The defeat of the superior fleet of Licinius by Flavius Julius
Crispus, Constantine&rsquo;s eldest son, compelled his withdrawal
to Bithynia, where a last stand was made; the battle of
Chrysopolis, near Chalcedon (18th of September), finally resulted
in his submission. He was interned at Thessalonica and executed
in the following year on a charge of treasonable correspondence
with the barbarians.</p>

on questions connected with rhetoric, perhaps (if the reading be
correct) the <i>commentarii</i> alluded to by Tacitus (<i>Dialogus</i>, 23;
compare also Cicero, <i>Ad Fam.</i> xv. 21). Twenty-one speeches
by him are mentioned, amongst which the most famous were

<p><span class="bold">LICTORS<a name="ar107" id="ar107"></a></span> (<i>lictores</i>), in Roman antiquities, a class of the
attendants (<i>apparitores</i>) upon certain Roman and provincial
magistrates.<a name="fa1l" id="fa1l" href="#ft1l"><span class="sp">1</span></a> As an institution (supposed by some to have
been borrowed from Etruria) they went back to the regal period
and continued to exist till imperial times. The majority of the
city lictors were freedmen; they formed a corporation divided
into decuries, from which the lictors of the magistrates in office
were drawn; provincial officials had the nomination of their
own. In Rome they wore the toga, perhaps girded up; on a
campaign and at the celebration of a triumph, the red military
cloak (<i>sagulum</i>); at funerals, black. As representatives of magistrates
who possessed the <i>imperium</i>, they carried the fasces and
axes in front of them (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Fasces</a></span>). They were exempt from
military service; received a fixed salary; theoretically they were
nominated for a year, but really for life. They were the constant
attendants, both in and out of the house, of the magistrate to
whom they were attached. They walked before him in Indian
file, cleared a passage for him (<i>summovere</i>) through the crowd,
and saw that he was received with the marks of respect due to
his rank. They stood by him when he took his seat on the
tribunal; mounted guard before his house, against the wall of
which they stood the fasces; summoned offenders before him,
seized, bound and scourged them, and (in earlier times) carried
out the death sentence. It should be noted that directly a
magistrate entered an allied, independent state, he was obliged
to dispense with his lictors. The king had twelve lictors; each
of the consuls (immediately after their institution) twelve,
subsequently limited to the monthly officiating consul, although
Caesar appears to have restored the original arrangement; the
dictator, as representing both consuls, twenty-four; the emperors
twelve, until the time of Domitian, who had twenty-four. The
Flamen Dialis, each of the Vestals, the <i>magister-vicorum</i> (overseer
of the sections into which the city was divided) were also
accompanied by lictors. These lictors were probably supplied
from the <i>lictores curiatii</i>, thirty in number, whose functions were
specially religious, one of them being in attendance on the
pontifex maximus. They originally summoned the comitia
curiata, and when its meetings became merely a formality, acted
as the representatives of that assembly. Lictors were also
assigned to private individuals at the celebration of funeral
games, and to the aediles at the games provided by them and
the theatrical representations under their supervision.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIDDELL, HENRY GEORGE<a name="ar108" id="ar108"></a></span> (1811-1898), English scholar
and divine, eldest son of the Rev. Henry George Liddell, younger
brother of the first Baron Ravensworth, was born at Binchester,
near Bishop Auckland, on the 6th of February 1811. He was
educated at Charterhouse and Christ Church, Oxford. Gaining
a double first in 1833, Liddell became a college tutor, and was
ordained in 1838. In the same year Dean Gaisford appointed
him Greek reader in Christ Church, and in 1846 he was appointed
to the headmastership of Westminster School. Meanwhile his
life work, the great <i>Lexicon</i> (based on the German work of
F. Passow), which he and Robert Scott began as early as 1834,
had made good progress, and the first edition appeared in 1843.
It immediately became the standard Greek-English dictionary
and still maintains this rank, although, notwithstanding the
great additions made of late to our Greek vocabulary from
inscriptions, papyri and other sources, scarcely any enlargement
has been made since about 1880. The 8th edition was published
in 1897. As headmaster of Westminster Liddell enjoyed a
period of great success, followed by trouble due to the outbreak
of fever and cholera in the school. In 1855 he accepted the
deanery of Christ Church, then vacant by the death of Gaisford.
In the same year he brought out a <i>History of Ancient Rome</i>
(much used in an abridged form as the <i>Student&rsquo;s History of Rome</i>)
and took a very active part in the first Oxford University Commission.
His tall figure, fine presence and aristocratic mien
were for many years associated with all that was characteristic
of Oxford life. Coming just at the transition period when the
&ldquo;old Christ Church,&rdquo; which Pusey strove so hard to preserve,
was inevitably becoming broader and more liberal, it was chiefly
due to Liddell that necessary changes were effected with the
minimum of friction. In 1859 Liddell welcomed the then prince
of Wales when he matriculated at Christ Church, being the first
holder of that title who had matriculated since Henry V. In
conjunction with Sir Henry Acland, Liddell did much to encourage
the study of art at Oxford, and his taste and judgment
gained him the admiration and friendship of Ruskin. In 1891,
owing to advancing years, he resigned the deanery. The last
years of his life were spent at Ascot, where he died on the
18th of January 1898. Dean Liddell married in July 1846 Miss
Lorina Reeve (d. 1910), by whom he had a numerous family.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIDDESDALE,<a name="ar109" id="ar109"></a></span> the valley of Liddel Water, Roxburghshire,
Scotland, extending in a south-westerly direction from the
vicinity of Peel Fell to the Esk, a distance of 21 m. The Waverley
route of the North British railway runs down the dale, and the
Catrail, or Picts&rsquo; Dyke, crosses its head. At one period the points
of vantage on the river and its affluents were occupied with
freebooters&rsquo; peel-towers, but many of them have disappeared
and the remainder are in decay. Larriston Tower belonged
to the Elliots, Mangerton to the Armstrongs and Park to
&ldquo;little Jock Elliot,&rdquo; the outlaw who nearly killed Bothwell in
an encounter in 1566. The chief point of interest in the valley,
however, is Hermitage Castle, a vast, massive <b>H</b>-shaped fortress
of enormous strength, one of the oldest baronial buildings in
Scotland. It stands on a hill overlooking Hermitage Water,
a tributary of the Liddel. It was built in 1244 by Nicholas de
Soulis and was captured by the English in David II.&rsquo;s reign.
It was retaken by Sir William Douglas, who received a grant
of it from the king. In 1492 Archibald Douglas, 5th earl of
Angus, exchanged it for Bothwell Castle on the Clyde with
Patrick Hepburn, 1st earl of Bothwell. It finally passed to the
duke of Buccleuch, under whose care further ruin has been
arrested. It was here that Sir Alexander Ramsay of Dalhousie
was starved to death by Sir William Douglas in 1342, and that
James Hepburn, 4th earl of Bothwell, was visited by Mary,
queen of Scots, after the assault referred to.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>To the east of the castle is Ninestane Rig, a hill 943 ft. high,
4 m. long and 1 m. broad, where it is said that William de Soulis,
hated for oppression and cruelty, was (in 1320) boiled by his own
vassals in a copper cauldron, which was supported on two of the nine
stones which composed the &ldquo;Druidical&rdquo; circle that gave the ridge
its name. Only five of the stones remain. James Telfer (1802-1862),
the writer of ballads, who was born in the parish of Southdean
(pronounced Soudan), was for several years schoolmaster of Saughtree,
near the head of the valley. The castle of the lairds of Liddesdale
stood near the junction of Hermitage Water and the Liddel
and around it grew up the village of Castleton.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIDDON, HENRY PARRY<a name="ar110" id="ar110"></a></span> (1829-1890), English divine, was
the son of a naval captain and was born at North Stoneham,
Hampshire, on the 20th of August 1829. He was educated at
King&rsquo;s College School, London, and at Christ Church, Oxford,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page589" id="page589"></a>589</span>
where he graduated, taking a second class, in 1850. As vice-principal
of the theological college at Cuddesdon (1854-1859)
he wielded considerable influence, and, on returning to Oxford
as vice-principal of St Edmund&rsquo;s Hall, became a growing force
among the undergraduates, exercising his influence in strong
opposition to the liberal reaction against Tractarianism, which
had set in after Newman&rsquo;s secession in 1845. In 1864 the bishop
of Salisbury (W. K. Hamilton), whose examining chaplain he
had been, appointed him prebendary of Salisbury cathedral. In
1866 he delivered his Bampton Lectures on the doctrine of the
divinity of Christ. From that time his fame as a preacher,
which had been steadily growing, may be considered established.
In 1870 he was made canon of St Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral, London.
He had before this published <i>Some Words for God</i>, in which,
with great power and eloquence, he combated the scepticism
of the day. His preaching at St Paul&rsquo;s soon attracted vast
crowds. The afternoon sermon, which fell to the lot of the canon
in residence, had usually been delivered in the choir, but soon
after Liddon&rsquo;s appointment it became necessary to preach the
sermon under the dome, where from 3000 to 4000 persons used
to gather to hear the preacher. Few orators belonging to the
Church of England have acquired so great a reputation as
Liddon. Others may have surpassed him in originality, learning
or reasoning power, but for grasp of his subject, clearness of
language, lucidity of arrangement, felicity of illustration, vividness
of imagination, elegance of diction, and above all, for
sympathy with the intellectual position of those whom he
addressed, he has hardly been rivalled. In the elaborate arrangement
of his matter he is thought to have imitated the great
French preachers of the age of Louis XIV. In 1870 he had
also been made Ireland professor of exegesis at Oxford. The
combination of the two appointments gave him extensive
influence over the Church of England. With Dean Church he
may be said to have restored the waning influence of the Tractarian
school, and he succeeded in popularizing the opinions
which, in the hands of Pusey and Keble, had appealed to thinkers
and scholars. His forceful spirit was equally conspicuous in his
opposition to the Church Discipline Act of 1874, and in his
denunciation of the Bulgarian atrocities of 1876. In 1882 he
resigned his professorship and utilized his thus increased leisure
by travelling in Palestine and Egypt, and showed his interest
in the Old Catholic movement by visiting Döllinger at Munich.
In 1886 he became chancellor of St Paul&rsquo;s, and it is said that he
declined more than one offer of a bishopric. He died on the
9th of September 1890, in the full vigour of his intellect and at
the zenith of his reputation. He had undertaken and nearly
completed an elaborate life of Dr Pusey, for whom his admiration
was unbounded; and this work was completed after his death
by Messrs Johnston and Wilson. Liddon&rsquo;s great influence
during his life was due to his personal fascination and the beauty
of his pulpit oratory rather than to any high qualities of intellect.
As a theologian his outlook was that of the 16th rather than the
19th century; and, reading his Bampton Lectures now, it is
difficult to realize how they can ever have been hailed as a great
contribution to Christian apologetics. To the last he maintained
the narrow standpoint of Pusey and Keble, in defiance of all the
developments of modern thought and modern scholarship; and
his latter years were embittered by the consciousness that the
younger generation of the disciples of his school were beginning
to make friends of the Mammon of scientific unrighteousness.
The publication in 1889 of <i>Lux Mundi</i>, a series of essays attempting
to harmonize Anglican Catholic doctrine with modern
thought, was a severe blow to him, for it showed that even at
the Pusey House, established as the citadel of Puseyism at
Oxford, the principles of Pusey were being departed from.
Liddon&rsquo;s importance is now mainly historical. He was the last
of the classical pulpit orators of the English Church, the last
great popular exponent of the traditional Anglican orthodoxy.
Besides the works mentioned, Liddon published several volumes
of <i>Sermons</i>, a volume of Lent lectures entitled <i>Some Elements
of Religion</i> (1870), and a collection of <i>Essays and Addresses</i>
on such themes as Buddhism, Dante, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIE, JONAS LAURITZ EDEMIL<a name="ar111" id="ar111"></a></span> (1833-1908), Norwegian
novelist, was born on the 6th of November 1833 close to Hougsund
(Eker), near Drammen. In 1838, his father being appointed
sheriff of Tromsö, the family removed to that Arctic town.
Here the future novelist enjoyed an untrammelled childhood
among the shipping of the little Nordland capital, and gained
acquaintance with the wild seafaring life which he was afterwards
to describe. In 1846 he was sent to the naval school at
Frederiksvaern, but his extreme near-sight unfitted him for the
service, and he was transferred to the Latin school at Bergen.
In 1851 he went to the university of Christiania, where Ibsen
and Björnson were among his fellow-students. Jonas Lie,
however, showed at this time no inclination to literature. He
pursued his studies as a lawyer, took his degrees in law in 1858,
and settled down to practice as a solicitor in the little town
of Kongsvinger. In 1860 he married his cousin, Thomasine
Lie, whose collaboration in his work he acknowledged in 1893
in a graceful article in the <i>Samtiden</i> entitled &ldquo;Min hustru.&rdquo;
In 1866 he published his first book, a volume of poems. He
made unlucky speculations in wood, and the consequent financial
embarrassment induced him to return to Christiania to try
his luck as a man of letters. As a journalist he had no success,
but in 1870 he published a melancholy little romance, <i>Den Fremsynte</i>
(Eng. trans., <i>The Visionary</i>, 1894), which made him famous.
Lie proceeded to Rome, and published Tales in 1871 and <i>Tremasteren
&ldquo;Fremtiden&rdquo;</i> (Eng. trans., <i>The Barque &ldquo;Future,&rdquo;</i>
Chicago, 1879), a novel, in 1872. His first great book, however,
was <i>Lodsen og hans Hustru</i> (<i>The Pilot and his Wife</i>, 1874),
which placed him at the head of Norwegian novelists; it was
written in the little town of Rocca di Papa in the Albano mountains.
From that time Lie enjoyed, with Björnson and Ibsen,
a stipend as poet from the Norwegian government. Lie spent
the next few years partly in Dresden, partly in Stuttgart, with
frequent summer excursions to Berchtesgaden in the Bavarian
highlands. During his exile he produced the drama in verse
called <i>Faustina Strozzi</i> (1876). Returning to Norway, Lie
began a series of romances of modern life in Christiania, of
which <i>Thomas Ross</i> (1878) and <i>Adam Schrader</i> (1879) were the
earliest. He returned to Germany, and settled first in Dresden
again, then in Hamburg, until 1882, when he took up his abode
in Paris, where he lived in close retirement in the society of
Scandinavian friends. His summers were spent at Berchtesgaden
in Tirol. The novels of his German period are <i>Rutland</i>
(1881) and <i>Gaa paa</i> (&ldquo;<i>Go Ahead!</i>&rdquo; 1882), tales of life in the
Norwegian merchant navy. His subsequent works, produced
with great regularity, enjoyed an immense reputation in Norway.
Among the best of them are: <i>Livsslaven</i> (1883, Eng. trans.,
&ldquo;<i>One of Life&rsquo;s Slaves</i>,&rdquo; 1895); <i>Familjen paa Gilje</i> (&ldquo;<i>The Family
of Gilje</i>,&rdquo; 1883); <i>Malstroem</i> (1885), describing the gradual
ruin of a Norwegian family; <i>Et Samliv</i> (&ldquo;<i>Life in Common</i>,&rdquo;
1887), describing a marriage of convenience. Two of the most
successful of his novels were <i>The Commodore&rsquo;s Daughters</i> (1886)
and Niobe (1894), both of which were presented to English readers
in the International library, edited by Mr Gosse. In 1891-1892
he wrote, under the influence of the new romantic impulse,
twenty-four folk-tales, printed in two volumes entitled <i>Trold</i>.
Some of these were translated by R. N. Bain in <i>Weird Tales</i>
(1893), illustrated by L. Housman. Among his later works
were the romance <i>Naar Sol gaar ned</i> (&ldquo;<i>When the Sun goes down</i>,&rdquo;
1895), the powerful novel of <i>Dyre Rein</i> (1896), the fairy drama
of <i>Lindelin</i> (1897), <i>Faste Forland</i> (1899), a romance which contains
much which is autobiographical, <i>When the Iron Curtain
falls</i> (1901), and <i>The Consul</i> (1904). <i>His Samlede Vaerker</i>
were published at Copenhagen in 14 vols. (1902-1904). Jonas
Lie left Paris in 1891, and, after spending a year in Rome,
returned to Norway, establishing himself at Holskogen, near
Christiansand. He died at Christiania on the 5th of July 1908.
As a novelist he stands with those minute and unobtrusive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page590" id="page590"></a>590</span>
painters of contemporary manners who defy arrangement in
this or that school. He is with Mrs Gaskell or Ferdinand Fabre;
he is not entirely without relation with that old-fashioned
favourite of the public, Fredrika Bremer.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>His son, Erik Lie (b. 1868), published a successful volume of
stories, <i>Med Blyanten</i>, in 1890; and is also the author of various
works on literary history. An elder son, Mons Lie (b. 1864), studied
the violin in Paris, but turned to literature in 1894. Among his
works are the plays <i>Tragedier om Kjaerlighed</i> (1897); <i>Lombardo and
Agrippina</i> (1898); <i>Don Juan</i> (1900); and the novels, <i>Sjöfareren</i>
(1901); <i>Adam Ravn</i> (1903) and <i>I. Kvindensnet</i> (1904).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIE, MARIUS SOPHUS<a name="ar112" id="ar112"></a></span> (1842-1899), Norwegian mathematician,
was born at Nordfjordeif, near Bergen, on the 17th of
December 1842, and was educated at the university of Christiania,
where he took his doctor&rsquo;s degree in 1868 and became
extraordinary professor of mathematics (a chair created specially
for him) four years later. In 1886 he was chosen to succeed
Felix Klein in the chair of geometry at Leipzig, but as his fame
grew a special post was arranged for him in Christiania. But
his health was broken down by too assiduous study, and he died
at Christiania on the 18th of February 1899, six months after
his return. Lie&rsquo;s work exercised a great influence on the progress
of mathematical science during the later decades of the 19th
century. His primary aim has been declared to be the advancement
and elaboration of the theory of differential equations,
and it was with this end in view that he developed his theory
of transformation groups, set forth in his <i>Theorie der Transformationsgruppen</i>
(3 vols., Leipzig, 1888-1893), a work of
wide range and great originality, by which probably his name
is best known. A special application of his theory of continuous
groups was to the general problem of non-Euclidean geometry.
The latter part of the book above mentioned was devoted
to a study of the foundations of geometry, considered from
the standpoint of B. Riemann and H. von Helmholtz; and
he intended to publish a systematic exposition of his geometrical
investigations, in conjunction with Dr G. Scheffers, but only
one volume made its appearance (<i>Geometrie der Berührungstransformationen</i>,
Leipzig, 1896). Lie was a foreign member
of the Royal Society, as well as an honorary member of the
Cambridge Philosophical Society and the London Mathematical
Society, and his geometrical inquiries gained him the much-coveted
honour of the Lobatchewsky prize.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIEBER, FRANCIS<a name="ar113" id="ar113"></a></span> (1800-1872), German-American publicist,
was born at Berlin on the 18th of March 1800. He served
with his two brothers under Blücher in the campaign of 1815,
fighting at Ligny, Waterloo and Namur, where he was twice
dangerously wounded. Shortly afterwards he was arrested
for his political sentiments, the chief evidence against him
being several songs of liberty which he had written. After
several months he was discharged without a trial, but was
forbidden to pursue his studies at the Prussian universities.
He accordingly went to Jena, where he took his degrees in 1820,
continuing his studies at Halle and Dresden. He subsequently
took part in the Greek War of Independence, publishing his
experiences in his <i>Journal in Greece</i> (Leipzig, 1823, and under
the title <i>The German Anacharsis</i>, Amsterdam, 1823). For a
year he was in Rome as tutor to the son of the historian Niebuhr,
then Prussian ambassador. Returning to Berlin in 1823, he
was imprisoned at Koepenik, but was released after some months
through the influence of Niebuhr. In 1827 he went to the
United States and as soon as possible was naturalized as a
citizen. He settled at Boston, and for five years edited <i>The
Encyclopaedia Americana</i> (13 vols.). From 1835 to 1856 he was
professor of history and political economy in South Carolina
College at Columbia, S.C., and during this period wrote his
three chief works, <i>Manual of Political Ethics</i> (1838), <i>Legal and
Political Hermeneutics</i> (1839), and <i>Civil Liberty and Self Government</i>
(1853). In 1856 he resigned and next year was elected
to a similar post in Columbia College, New York, and in 1865
became professor of constitutional history and public law in the
same institution. During the Civil War Lieber rendered services
of great value to the government. He was one of the first to
point out the madness of secession, and was active in upholding
the Union. He prepared, upon the requisition of the president,
the important <i>Code of War for the Government of the Armies
of the United States in the Field</i>, which was promulgated by
the Government in General Orders No. 100 of the war department.
This code suggested to Bluntschli his codification of the law
of nations, as may be seen in the preface to his <i>Droit International
Codifié</i>. During this period also Lieber wrote his <i>Guerilla
Parties with Reference to the Laws and Usages of War</i>. At the
time of his death he was the umpire of the commission for the
adjudication of Mexican claims. He died on the 2nd of October
1872. His books were acquired by the University of California,
and his papers were placed in the Johns Hopkins University.</p>

he entered the school of art at Weimar in 1869. Though the
straightforward simplicity of his first exhibited picture, &ldquo;Women
plucking Geese,&rdquo; in 1872, presented already a striking contrast
to the conventional art then in vogue, it was heavy and

in 1873, where he became personally acquainted with Millet
and had occasion to study the works of Corot, Troyon, and
Daubigny, resulted in the clearing and brightening of his palette,
and taught him to forget the example of Munkacsy, under whose
influence he had produced his first pictures in Paris. He subsequently
went to Holland, where the example of Israels confirmed
him in the method he had adopted at Barbizon; but on
his return to Munich in 1878 he caused much unfavourable
criticism by his realistic painting of &ldquo;Christ in the Temple,&rdquo;
which was condemned by the clergy as irreverent and remained
his only attempt at a scriptural subject. Henceforth he devoted
himself exclusively to the study of free-light and to the painting
of the life of humble folk. He found his best subjects in the
orphanages and asylums for the old in Amsterdam, among the
peasants in the fields and village streets of Holland, and in the
beer-gardens, factories, and workrooms of his own country.
Germany was reluctant, however, in admitting the merit of an
artist whose style and method were so markedly at variance
with the time-honoured academic tradition. Only when his
fame was echoed back from France, Belgium, and Holland
did his compatriots realize the eminent position which is his due
in the history of German art. It is hardly too much to say that
Liebermann has done for his country what Millet did for France.
His pictures hold the fragrance of the soil and the breezes of
the heavens. His people move in their proper atmosphere,
and their life is stated in all its monotonous simplicity, without
artificial pathos or melodramatic exaggeration. His first success
was a medal awarded him for &ldquo;An Asylum for Old Men&rdquo; at
the 1881 Salon. In 1884 he settled again in Berlin, where he
became professor of the Academy in 1898. He became a member
of the Société nationale des Beaux Arts, of the Société royale
belge des Aquarellistes, and of the Cercle des Aquarellistes at
the Hague. Liebermann is represented in most of the German
and other continental galleries. The Berlin National
Gallery owns &ldquo;The Flax-Spinners&rdquo;; the Munich Pinakothek,
&ldquo;The Woman with Goats&rdquo;; the Hamburg Gallery, &ldquo;The
Net-Menders&rdquo;; the Hanover Gallery, the &ldquo;Village Street in
Holland.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Seamstress&rdquo; is at the Dresden Gallery;
the &ldquo;Man on the Dunes&rdquo; at Leipzig; &ldquo;Dutch Orphan Girls&rdquo;
at Strassburg; &ldquo;Beer-cellar at Brandenburg&rdquo; at the Luxembourg
Museum in Paris, and the &ldquo;Knöpflerinnen&rdquo; in Venice.
His etchings are to be found in the leading print cabinets of
Europe.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIEBIG, JUSTUS VON,<a name="ar115" id="ar115"></a></span> <span class="sc">Baron</span> (1803-1873), German chemist,
was born at Darmstadt, according to his baptismal certificate,
on the 12th of May 1803 (4th of May, according to his mother).
His father, a drysalter and dealer in colours, used sometimes to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page591" id="page591"></a>591</span>
make experiments in the hope of finding improved processes
for the production of his wares, and thus his son early acquired
familiarity with practical chemistry. For the theoretical side
he read all the text-books which he could find, somewhat to the
detriment of his ordinary school studies. Having determined
to make chemistry his profession, at the age of fifteen he entered
the shop of an apothecary at Appenheim, near Darmstadt;
but he soon found how great is the difference between practical
pharmacy and scientific chemistry, and the explosions and other
incidents that accompanied his private efforts to increase his
chemical knowledge disposed his master to view without regret
his departure at the end of ten months. He next entered the
university of Bonn, but migrated to Erlangen when the professor
of chemistry, K. W. G. Kastner (1783-1857), was appointed in
1821 to the chair of physics and chemistry at the latter university.
He followed this professor to learn how to analyse certain
minerals, but in the end he found that the teacher himself was
ignorant of the process. Indeed, as he himself said afterwards,
it was a wretched time for chemistry in Germany. No laboratories
were accessible to ordinary students, who had to content
themselves with what the universities could give in the lecture-room
and the library, and though both at Bonn and Erlangen
Liebig endeavoured to make up for the deficiencies of the
official instruction by founding a students&rsquo; physical and chemical
society for the discussion of new discoveries and speculations,
he felt that he could never become a chemist in his own country.
Therefore, having graduated as Ph.D. in 1822, he left Erlangen&mdash;where
he subsequently complained that the contagion of the
&ldquo;greatest philosopher and metaphysician of the century&rdquo;
(Schelling), in a period &ldquo;rich in words and ideas, but poor in
true knowledge and genuine studies,&rdquo; had cost him two precious
years of his life&mdash;and by the liberality of Louis I., grand-duke
of Hesse-Darmstadt, was enabled to go to Paris. By the help
of L. J. Thénard he gained admission to the private laboratory
of H. F. Gaultier de Claubry (1792-1873), professor of chemistry
at the École de Pharmacie, and soon afterwards, by the influence
of A. von Humboldt, to that of Gay-Lussac, where in 1824 he
concluded his investigations on the composition of the fulminates.
It was on Humboldt&rsquo;s advice that he determined to become a
teacher of chemistry, but difficulties stood in his way. As a
native of Hesse-Darmstadt he ought, according to the academical
rules of the time, to have studied and graduated at the university
of Giessen, and it was only through the influence of Humboldt
that the authorities forgave him for straying to the foreign
university of Erlangen. After examination his Erlangen degree
was recognized, and in 1824 he was appointed extraordinary
professor of chemistry at Giessen, becoming ordinary professor
two years later. In this small town his most important work
was accomplished. His first care was to persuade the Darmstadt
government to provide a chemical laboratory in which the
students might obtain a proper practical training. This laboratory,
unique of its kind at the time, in conjunction with Liebig&rsquo;s
unrivalled gifts as a teacher, soon rendered Giessen the most
famous chemical school in the world; men flocked from every
country to enjoy its advantages, and many of the most accomplished
chemists of the 19th century had to thank it for their
early training. Further, it gave a great impetus to the progress
of chemical education throughout Germany, for the continued
admonitions of Liebig combined with the influence of his pupils
induced many other universities to build laboratories modelled
on the same plan. He remained at Giessen for twenty-eight years,
until in 1852 he accepted the invitation of the Bavarian government
to the ordinary chair of chemistry at Munich university,
and this office he held, although he was offered the chair at
Berlin in 1865, until his death, which occurred at Munich on
the 10th of April 1873.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Apart from Liebig&rsquo;s labours for the improvement of chemical
teaching, the influence of his experimental researches and of his
contributions to chemical thought was felt in every branch of the
science. In regard to methods and apparatus, mention should be
made of his improvements in the technique of organic analysis,
his plan for determining the natural alkaloids and for ascertaining
the molecular weights of organic bases bv means of their chloroplatinates,
his process for determining the quantity of urea in a
solution&mdash;the first step towards the introduction of precise chemical
methods into practical medicine&mdash;and his invention of the simple
form of condenser known in every laboratory. His contributions
to inorganic chemistry were numerous, including investigations on
the compounds of antimony, aluminium, silicon, &amp;c., on the separation
of nickel and cobalt, and on the analysis of mineral waters, but
they are outweighed in importance by his work on organic substances.
In this domain his first research was on the fulminates of
mercury and silver, and his study of these bodies led him to the
discovery of the isomerism of cyanic and fulminic acids, for the
composition of fulminic acid as found by him was the same as that
of cyanic acid, as found by F. Wöhler, and it became necessary to
admit them to be two bodies which differed in properties, though
of the same percentage composition. Further work on cyanogen
and connected substances yielded a great number of interesting
derivatives, and he described an improved method for the manufacture
of potassium cyanide, an agent which has since proved of
enormous value in metallurgy and the arts. In 1832 he published,
jointly with Wöhler, one of the most famous papers in the history
of chemistry, that on the oil of bitter almonds (benzaldehyde),
wherein it was shown that the radicle benzoyl might be regarded
as forming an unchanging constituent of a long series of compounds
obtained from oil of bitter almonds, throughout which it behaved
like an element. Berzelius hailed this discovery as marking the
dawn of a new era in organic chemistry, and proposed for benzoyl
the names &ldquo;Proïn&rdquo; or &ldquo;Orthrin&rdquo; (from <span class="grk" title="prôi">&#960;&#961;&#969;&#943;</span> and <span class="grk" title="örthrus">&#8004;&#961;&#952;&#961;&#965;&#962;</span>). A
continuation of their work on bitter almond oil by Liebig and
Wöhler, who remained firm friends for the rest of their lives, resulted
in the elucidation of the mode of formation of that substance and in
the discovery of the ferment emulsin as well as the recognition of the
first glucoside, amygdalin, while another and not less important
and far-reaching inquiry in which they collaborated was that on
uric acid, published in 1837. About 1832 he began his investigations
into the constitution of ether and alcohol and their derivatives.
These on the one hand resulted in the enunciation of his ethyl
theory, by the light of which he looked upon those substances as
compounds of the radicle ethyl (C<span class="su">2</span>H<span class="su">5</span>), in opposition to the view
of J. B. A. Dumas, who regarded them as hydrates of olefiant gas
(ethylene); on the other they yielded chloroform, chloral and
aldehyde, as well as other compounds of less general interest, and
also the method of forming mirrors by depositing silver from a
slightly ammoniacal solution by acet aldehyde. In 1837 with
Dumas he published a note on the constitution of organic acids, and
in the following year an elaborate paper on the same subject appeared
under his own name alone; by this work T. Graham&rsquo;s doctrine of
polybasicity was extended to the organic acids. Liebig also did
much to further the hydrogen theory of acids.</p>

<p>These and other studies in pure chemistry mainly occupied his
attention until about 1838, but the last thirty-five years of his life were
devoted more particularly to the chemistry of the processes of life,
both animal and vegetable. In animal physiology he set himself
to trace out the operation of determinate chemical and physical
laws in the maintenance of life and health. To this end he examined
such immediate vital products as blood, bile and urine; he analysed
the juices of flesh, establishing the composition of creatin and
investigating its decomposition products, creatinin and sarcosin;
he classified the various articles of food in accordance with the
special function performed by each in the animal economy, and
expounded the philosophy of cooking; and in opposition to many
of the medical opinions of his time taught that the heat of the
body is the result of the processes of combustion and oxidation
performed within the organism. A secondary result of this line of
study was the preparation of his food for infants and of his extract
of meat. Vegetable physiology he pursued with special reference
to agriculture, which he held to be the foundation of all trade
and industry, but which could not be rationally practised without
the guidance of chemical principles. His first publication on this
subject was <i>Die Chemie in ihrer Anwendung auf Agricultur und
Physiologie</i> in 1840, which was at once translated into English by
Lyon Playfair. Rejecting the old notion that plants derive their
nourishment from humus, he taught that they get carbon and
nitrogen from the carbon dioxide and ammonia present in the
atmosphere, these compounds being returned by them to the
atmosphere by the processes of putrefaction and fermentation&mdash;which
latter he regarded as essentially chemical in nature&mdash;while
their potash, soda, lime, sulphur, phosphorus, &amp;c., come from the
soil. Of the carbon dioxide and ammonia no exhaustion can take
place, but of the mineral <span class="correction" title="amended from constitutents">constituents</span> the supply is limited because
the soil cannot afford an indefinite amount of them; hence the chief
care of the farmer, and the function of manures, is to restore to the
soil those minerals which each crop is found, by the analysis of its
ashes, to take up in its growth. On this theory he prepared artificial
manures containing the essential mineral substances together with
a small quantity of ammoniacal salts, because he held that the air
does not supply ammonia fast enough in certain cases, and carried
out systematic experiments on ten acres of poor sandy land which
he obtained from the town of Giessen in 1845. But in practice the
results were not wholly satisfactory, and it was a long time before
he recognized one important reason for the failure in the fact that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page592" id="page592"></a>592</span>
to prevent the alkalis from being washed away by the rain he had
taken pains to add them in an insoluble form, whereas, as was
ultimately suggested to him by experiments performed by J. T.
Way about 1850, this precaution was not only superfluous but
harmful, because the soil possesses a power of absorbing the soluble
saline matters required by plants and of retaining them, in spite of
rain, for assimilation by the roots.</p>

<p>Liebig&rsquo;s literary activity was very great. The Royal Society&rsquo;s
<i>Catalogue of Scientific Papers</i> enumerates 318 memoirs under his
name, exclusive of many others published in collaboration with
other investigators. A certain impetuousness of character which
disposed him to rush into controversy whenever doubt was cast
upon the views he supported accounted for a great deal of writing,
and he also carried on an extensive correspondence with Wöhler
and other scientific men. In 1832 he founded the <i>Annalen der
Pharmazie</i>, which became the <i>Annalen der Chemie und Pharmazie</i>
in 1840 when Wöhler became joint-editor with himself, and in 1837
with Wöhler and Poggendorff he established the <i>Handwörterbuch
der reinen und angewandten Chemie</i>. After the death of Berzelius
he continued the <i>Jahresbericht</i> with H. F. M. Kopp. The following
are his most important separate publications, many of which were
translated into English and French almost as soon as they appeared:
<i>Anleitung zur Analyse der organischen Körper</i> (1837);
<i>Die Chemie in ihrer Anwendung auf Agrikultur und Physiologie</i>
(1840); <i>Die Thier-Chemie oder die organische Chemie in ihrer Anwendung
auf Physiologie und Pathologie</i> (1842); <i>Handbuch der organischen
Chemie mit Rücksicht auf Pharmazie</i> (1843); <i>Chemische Briefe</i>
(1844); <i>Chemische Untersuchungen über das Fleisch und seine
Zubereitung zum Nahrungsmittel</i> (1847); <i>Die Grundsätze der Agrikultur-Chemie</i>
(1855); <i>Über Theorie und Praxis in der Landwirthschaft</i>
(1856); <i>Naturwissenschaftliche Briefe über die moderne Landwirtschaft</i>
(1859). A posthumous collection of his miscellaneous
addresses and publications appeared in 1874 as <i>Reden und Abhandlungen</i>,
edited by his son George (b. 1827). His criticism of Bacon,
<i>Über Francis von Verulam</i>, was first published in 1863 in the <i>Augsburger
allgemeine Zeitung</i>, where also most of his letters on chemistry
made their first appearance.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIEBKNECHT, WILHELM<a name="ar116" id="ar116"></a></span> (1826-1900), German socialist,
was burn at Giessen on the 29th of March 1826. Left an orphan
at an early age, he was educated at the gymnasium in his native
town, and attended the universities of Giessen, Bonn and
Marburg. Before he left school he had become affected by
the political discontent then general in Germany; he had already
studied the writings of St Simon, from which he gained his first
interest in communism, and had been converted to the extreme
republican theories of which Giessen was a centre. He soon
came into conflict with the authorities, and was expelled from
Berlin apparently in consequence of the strong sympathy he
displayed for some Poles, who were being tried for high treason.
He proposed in 1846 to migrate to America, but went instead
to Switzerland, where he earned his living as a teacher. As soon
as the revolution of 1848 broke out he hastened to Paris, but
the attempt to organize a republican corps for the invasion of
Germany was prevented by the government. In September,
however, in concert with Gustav von Struve, he crossed the
Rhine from Switzerland at the head of a band of volunteers,
and proclaimed a republic in Baden. The attempt collapsed;
he was captured, and, after suffering eight months&rsquo; imprisonment,
was brought to trial. Fortunately for him, a new rising had
just broken out; the mob burst into the court, and he was
acquitted. During the short duration of the revolutionary
government he was an active member of the most extreme
party, but on the arrival of the Prussian troops he succeeded in
escaping to France. Thence he went to Geneva, where he
came into intercourse with Mazzini; but, unlike most of the
German exiles, he was already an adherent of the socialist creed,
which at that time was more strongly held in France. Expelled
from Switzerland he went to London, where he lived for thirteen
years in close association with Karl Marx. He endured great
hardships, but secured a livelihood by teaching and writing;
he was a correspondent of the <i>Augsburger Allgemeine Zeitung</i>.
The amnesty of 1861 opened for him the way back to Germany,
and in 1862 he accepted the post of editor of the <i>Norddeutsche
Allgemeine Zeitung</i>, the founder of which was an old revolutionist.
Only a few months elapsed before the paper, passed under
Bismarck&rsquo;s influence. There is no more curious episode in
German history than the success with which Bismarck acquired
the services of many of the men of 1848, but Liebknecht remained
faithful to his principles and resigned his editorship. He became
a member of the Arbeiterverein, and after the death of Ferdinand
Lassalle he was the chief mouthpiece in Germany of Karl Marx,
and was instrumental in spreading the influence of the newly-founded
<i>International</i>. Expelled from Prussia in 1865, he
settled at Leipzig, and it is primarily to his activity in Saxony
among the newly-formed unions of workers that the modern
social democrat party owes its origin. Here he conducted the
<i>Demokratisches Wochenblatt</i>. In 1867 he was elected a member
of the North German Reichstag, but in opposition to Lassalle&rsquo;s
followers he refused all compromise with the &ldquo;capitalists,&rdquo;
and avowedly used his position merely for purposes of agitation
whilst taking every opportunity for making the parliament
ridiculous. He was strongly influenced by the &ldquo;great German&rdquo;
traditions of the democrats of 1848, and, violently anti-Prussian,
he distinguished himself by his attacks on the policy of 1866
and the &ldquo;revolution from above,&rdquo; and by his opposition to
every form of militarism. His adherence to the traditions of
1848 are also seen in his dread of Russia, which he maintained
to his death. His opposition to the war of 1870 exposed him to
insults and violence, and in 1872 he was condemned to two
years&rsquo; imprisonment in a fortress for treasonable intentions.
The Union of the German Socialists in 1874 at the congress of
Gotha was really a triumph of his influence, and from that time
he was regarded as founder and leader of the party. From 1874
till his death he was a member of the German Reichstag, and
for many years also of the Saxon diet. He was one of the chief
spokesmen of the party, and he took a very important part in
directing its policy. In 1881 he was expelled from Leipzig,
but took up his residence in a neighbouring village. After the
lapse of the Socialist law (1890) he became chief editor of the
<i>Vorwärts</i>, and settled in Berlin. If he did not always find it
easy in his later years to follow the new developments, he
preserved to his death the idealism of his youth, the hatred both
of Liberalism and of State Socialism; and though he was to
some extent overshadowed by Bebel&rsquo;s greater oratorical power,
he was the chief support of the orthodox Marxian tradition.
Liebknecht was the author of numerous pamphlets and books,
of which the most important were: <i>Robert Blum und seine Zeit</i>
(Nuremberg, 1892); <i>Geschichte der Französischen Revolution</i>
(Dresden, 1890); <i>Die Emser Depesche</i> (Nuremberg, 1899) and
<i>Robert Owen</i> (Nuremberg, 1892). He died at Charlottenburg
on the 6th of August 1900.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIECHTENSTEIN,<a name="ar117" id="ar117"></a></span> the smallest independent state in Europe,
save San Marino and Monaco. It lies some way S. of the Lake
of Constance, and extends along the right bank of the Rhine,
opposite Swiss territory, between Sargans and Sennwald, while
on the E. it also comprises the upper portion of the Samina
glen that joins the Ill valley at Frastanz, above Feldkirch.
It is about 12 m. in length, and covers an area of 61.4 or 68.8
sq. m. (according to different estimates). Its loftiest point
rises at the S.E. angle of the state, in the Rhätikon range, and
is named to Naafkopf or the Rothe Wand (8445 ft.); on its
summit the Swiss, Vorarlberg, and Liechtenstein frontiers join.
In 1901 the population was 9477 (of whom 4890 were women
and 4587 men). The capital is Vaduz (1523 ft.), with about
1100 inhabitants, and 2 m. S. of the Schaan railway station,
which is 2 m. from Buchs (Switz.). Even in the 17th century
the Romonsch language was not extinguished in the state, and
many Romonsch place-names still linger, <i>e.g.</i> Vaduz, Samina,
Gavadura, &amp;c. Now the population is German-speaking and
Romanist. The constitution of 1862 was amended in 1878,
1895 and 1901. All males of 24 years of age are primary electors,
while the diet consists of 12 members, holding their seats for
4 years and elected indirectly, together with 3 members nominated
by the prince. The prince has a lieutenant resident at
Vaduz, whence there is an appeal to the prince&rsquo;s court at Vienna,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page593" id="page593"></a>593</span>
with a final appeal (since 1884) to the supreme district court at
Innsbruck. Compulsory military service was abolished in 1868,
the army having till then been 91 strong. The principality
forms ecclesiastically part of the diocese of Coire, while as regards
customs duties it is joined with the Vorarlberg, and as regards
postal and coinage arrangements with Austria, which (according
to the agreement of 1852, renewed in 1876, by which the principality
entered the Austrian customs union) must pay it at least
40,000 crowns annually. In 1904 the revenues of the principality
amounted to 888,931 crowns, and its expenditure to 802,163
crowns. There is no public debt.</p>

<p>The county of Vaduz and the lordship of Schellenberg passed
through many hands before they were bought in 1613 by the
count of Hohenems (to the N. of Feldkirch). In consequence
of financial embarrassments, that family had to sell both (the
lordship in 1699, the county in 1713) to the Liechtenstein family,
which had since the 12th century owned two castles of that
name (both now ruined), one in Styria and the other a little
S.W. of Vienna. In 1719 these new acquisitions were raised
by the emperor into a principality under the name of Liechtenstein,
which formed part successively of the Holy Roman
Empire (till 1806) and of the German Confederation (1815-1866),
having been sovereign 1806-1815 as well as since 1866.</p>

the east the Dutch province of Limburg and the German district
of Rhenish Prussia. To a certain extent it may be assumed
to represent the old prince-bishopric. Besides the city of Liége it
contains the towns of Verviers, Dolhain, Seraing, Huy, &amp;c.
The Meuse flows through the centre of the province, and its
valley from Huy down to Herstal is one of the most productive
mineral districts in Belgium. Much has been done of late years
to develop the agricultural resources of the Condroz district south
of the Meuse. The area of the province is 723,470 acres, or
1130 sq. m. The population in 1904 was 863,254, showing an
average of 763 per sq. m.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIÉGE<a name="ar119" id="ar119"></a></span> (Walloon, <i>Lige</i>, Flemish, <i>Luik</i>, Ger. <i>Lüttich</i>), the capital
of the Belgian province that bears its name. It is finely situated
on the Meuse, and was long the seat of a prince-bishopric. It is
the centre of the Walloon country, and Scott commits a curious
mistake in <i>Quentin Durward</i> in making its people talk Flemish.
The Liége Walloon is the nearest existing approach to the old
Romance language. The importance of the city to-day arises
from its being the chief manufacturing centre in Belgium, and
owing to its large output of arms it has been called the Birmingham
of the Netherlands. The productive coal-mines of the
Meuse valley, extending from its western suburb of Seraing to its
northern faubourg of Herstal, constitute its chief wealth. At
Seraing is established the famous manufacturing firm of Cockerill,
whose offices are in the old summer palace of the prince-bishops.</p>

<p>The great cathedral of St Lambert was destroyed and sacked
by the French in 1794, and in 1802 the church of St Paul, dating
from the 10th century but rebuilt in the 13th, was declared the
cathedral. The law courts are installed in the old palace of the
prince-bishops, a building which was constructed by Bishop
Everard de la Marck between 1508 and 1540. The new boulevards
are well laid out, especially those flanking the river, and
the views of the city and surrounding country are very fine.
The university, which has separate schools for mines and arts and
manufactures, is one of the largest in the country, and enjoys
a high reputation for teaching in its special line.</p>

<p>Liége is a fortified position of far greater strength than is
generally appreciated. In the wars of the 18th century Liége
played but a small part. It was then defended only by the
citadel and a detached fort on the right side of the Meuse, but
at a short distance from the river, called the Chartreuse. Marlborough
captured these forts in 1703 in preparation for his advance
in the following year into Germany which resulted in the victory
of Blenheim. The citadel and the Chartreuse were still the only
defences of Liége in 1888 when, after long discussions, the Belgian
authorities decided on adequately fortifying the two important
passages of the Meuse at Liége and Namur. A similar plan was
adopted at each place, viz. the construction of a number of
detached forts along a perimeter drawn at a distance varying
from 4 to 6 m. of the town, so as to shelter it so far as possible from
bombardment. At Liége twelve forts were constructed, six on
the right bank and six on the left. Those on the right bank
beginning at the north and following an eastern curve are
Barchon, Evegnée, Fléron, Chaudfontaine, Embourg and
Boncelles. The average distance between each fort is 4 m., but
Fléron and Chaudfontaine are separated by little over 1 m.
in a direct line as they defend the main line of railway from
Germany. The six forts on the left bank also commencing
at the north, but following a western curve, are Pontisse, Liers,
Lantin, Loncin, Hollogne and Flemalle. These forts were
constructed under the personal direction of General Brialmont,
and are on exactly the same principle as those he designed for
the formidable defences of Bucarest. All the forts are constructed
in concrete with casemates, and the heavy guns are
raised and lowered automatically. Communication is maintained
between the different forts by military roads in all cases,
and by steam tramways in some. It is estimated that 25,000
troops would be required for the defence of the twelve forts,
but the number is inadequate for the defence of so important
and extensive a position. The population of Liége, which in
1875 was only 117,600, had risen by 1900 to 157,760, and in
1905 it was 168,532.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;Liége first appears in history about the year 558, at
which date St Monulph, bishop of Tongres, built a chapel near
the confluence of the Meuse and the Legia. A century later
the town, which had grown up round this chapel, became the
favourite abode of St Lambert, bishop of Tongres, and here
he was assassinated. His successor St Hubert raised a splendid
church over the tomb of the martyred bishop about 720 and
made Liége his residence. It was not, however, until about 930
that the title bishop of Tongres was abandoned for that of bishop
of Liége. The episcopate of Notger (972-1008) was marked by
large territorial acquisitions, and the see obtained recognition
as an independent principality of the Empire. The popular
saying was &ldquo;Liége owes Notger to God, and everything else to
Notger.&rdquo; By the munificent encouragement of successive
bishops Liége became famous during the 11th century as a centre
of learning, but the history of the town for centuries records
little else than the continuous struggles of the citizens to free
themselves from the exactions of their episcopal sovereigns;
the aid of the emperor and of the dukes of Brabant being frequently
called in to repress the popular risings. In 1316 the
citizens compelled Bishop Adolph de la Marck to sign a charter,
which made large concessions to the popular demands. It was,
however, a triumph of short duration, and the troubles continued,
the insurgent subjects now and again obtaining a fleeting
success, only to be crushed by the armies of the powerful relatives
of the bishops, the houses of Brabant or of Burgundy. During
the episcopate of Louis de Bourbon (1456-1484) the Liégeois,
having expelled the bishop, had the temerity to declare war on
Philip V., duke of Burgundy. Philip&rsquo;s son, Charles the Bold,
utterly defeated them in 1467, and razed the walls of the town to
the ground. In the following year the citizens again revolted,
and Charles being once more successful delivered up the city
to sack and pillage for three days, and deprived the remnant of
the citizens of all their privileges. This incident is narrated in
<i>Quentin Durward</i>. The long episcopate of Eberhard de la Marck
(1505-1538) was a time of good administration and of quiet,
during which the town regained something of its former prosperity.
The outbreak of civil war between two factions, named
the <i>Cluroux</i> and the <i>Grignoux</i>, marked the opening of the 17th
century. Bishop Maximilian Henry of Bavaria (1650-1688)
at last put an end to the internal strife and imposed a regulation
(<i>règlement</i>) which abolished all the free institutions of the citizens
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page594" id="page594"></a>594</span>
and the power of the gilds. Between this date and the outbreak
of the French Revolution the chief efforts of the prince-bishops
were directed to maintaining neutrality in the various wars, and
preserving their territory from being ravaged by invading armies.
They were only in part successful. Liége was taken by Marlborough
in 1702, and the fortress was garrisoned by the Dutch
until 1718. The French revolutionary armies overran the
principality in 1792, and from 1794 to the fall of Napoleon it
was annexed to France, and was known as the department of
the Ourthe. The Congress of Vienna in 1815 decreed that Liége
with the other provinces of the southern Netherlands should
form part of the new kingdom of the Netherlands under the
rule of William I., of the house of Orange. The town of Liége
took an active part in the Belgian revolt of 1830, and since that
date the ancient principality has been incorporated in the
kingdom of Belgium.</p>

<p>The see, which at first bore the name of the bishopric of
Tongres, was under the metropolitan jurisdiction of the archbishops
of Cologne. The principality comprised besides the
town of Liége and its district, the counties of Looz and Hoorn,
the marquessate of Franchimont, and the duchy of Bouillon.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIEGE,<a name="ar120" id="ar120"></a></span> an adjective implying the mutual relationship of
a feudal superior and his vassal; the word is used as a substantive
of the feudal superior, more usually in this sense,
however, in the form &ldquo;liege lord,&rdquo; and also of the vassals, his
&ldquo;lieges.&rdquo; Hence the word is often used of the loyal subjects
of a sovereign, with no reference to feudal ties. It appears
that <i>ligeitas</i> or <i>ligentia</i>, the medieval Latin term for this relationship,
was restricted to a particular form of homage. According
to N. Broussel (<i>Nouvel examen de l&rsquo;usage général des fiefs en
France</i>, 1727) the homage of a &ldquo;liege&rdquo; was a stronger form
of the ordinary homage, the especial distinction being that
while the ordinary vassal only undertook forty days&rsquo; military
service, the liege promised to serve as long as the war might
last, in which his superior was engaged (cf. Ducange, <i>Glossarium</i>,
s.v. &ldquo;<i>Ligius</i>&rdquo;).</p>

<p>The etymology of the word has been much discussed. It
comes into English through the O. Fr. <i>lige</i> or <i>liege</i>, Med.
Lat. <i>ligius</i>. This was early connected with the Lat. <i>ligatus</i>,
bound, <i>ligare</i>, to bind, from the sense of the obligation of the
vassal to his lord, but this has been generally abandoned.
Broussel takes the Med. Lat. <i>liga</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, <i>foedus</i>, <i>confederatio</i>,
the English &ldquo;league,&rdquo; as the origin. Ducange connects it with
the word <i>lities</i>, which appears in a gloss of the Salic law, and
is defined as a <i>scriptitius</i>, <i>servus glebae</i>. The more usually
accepted derivation is now from the Old High Ger. <i>ledic</i>, or
<i>ledig</i>, meaning &ldquo;free&rdquo; (Mod. Ger. <i>ledig</i> means unoccupied,
<i>vacuus</i>). This is confirmed by the occurrence in a charter of
Otto of Benthem, 1253, of a word &ldquo;ledigh-man&rdquo; (quoted in
Ducange, <i>Glossarium</i>, s.v.), <i>Proinde affecti sumus ligius homo,
quod Teutonice dictur Ledighman</i>. Skeat, in explaining the
application of &ldquo;free&rdquo; to such a relationship as that subsisting
between a feudal superior and his vassal, says &ldquo;&rsquo;a <i>liege</i> lord&rsquo;
seems to have been the lord of a free band; and his <i>lieges</i>,
though serving under him, were privileged men, free from all
other obligations; their name being due to their <i>freedom</i>, not
to their service&rdquo; (<i>Etym. Dict.</i>, ed. 1898). A. Luchaire (<i>Manuel
des institutions françaises</i>, 1892, p. 189, n. 1) considers it difficult
to call a man &ldquo;free&rdquo; who is under a strict obligation to another;
further that the &ldquo;liege&rdquo; was not free from all obligation to a
third party, for the charters prove without doubt that the
&ldquo;liege men&rdquo; owed duty to more than one lord.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIEGNITZ,<a name="ar121" id="ar121"></a></span> a town in Germany, in the Prussian province
of Silesia, picturesquely situated on the Katzbach, just above
its junction with the Schwarzwasser, and 40 m. W.N.W, of
Breslau, on the main line of railway to Berlin via Sommerfeld.
Pop. (1885) 43,347, (1905) 59,710. It consists of an old town,
surrounded by pleasant, shady promenades, and several well-built
suburbs. The most prominent building is the palace,
formerly the residence of the dukes of Liegnitz, rebuilt after
a fire in 1835 and now used as the administrative offices of
the district. The Ritter Akademie, founded by the emperor
Joseph I. in 1708 for the education of the young Silesian nobles,
was reconstructed as a gymnasium in 1810. The Roman Catholic
church of St John, with two fine towers, contains the burial
vault of the dukes. The principal Lutheran church, that of
SS. Peter and Paul (restored in 1892-1894), dates from the
14th century. The manufactures are considerable, the chief
articles made being cloth, wool, leather, tobacco, pianos and
machinery. Its trade in grain and its cattle-markets are likewise
important. The large market gardens in the suburbs
grow vegetables of considerable annual value.</p>

<p>Liegnitz is first mentioned in an historical document in
the year 1004. In 1163 it became the seat of the dukes of
Liegnitz, who greatly improved and enlarged it. The dukes
were members of the illustrious Piast family, which gave many
kings to Poland. During the Thirty Years&rsquo; War Liegnitz was
taken by the Swedes, but was soon recaptured by the Imperialists.
The Saxon army also defeated the imperial troops near Liegnitz
in 1634. On the death of the last duke of Liegnitz in 1675,
the duchy came into the possession of the Empire, which retained
it until the Prussian conquest of Silesia in 1742. On the 15th of
August 1760 Frederick the Great gained a decisive victory near
Liegnitz over the Austrians, and in August 1813 Blücher defeated
the French in the neighbourhood at the battle of the Katzbach.
During the 19th century Liegnitz rapidly increased in population
and prosperity. In 1906 the German autumn man&oelig;uvres
were held over the terrain formerly the scene of the great battles
already mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIEN,<a name="ar122" id="ar122"></a></span> in law. The word <i>lien</i> is literally the French for a
band, cord or chain, and keeping in mind that meaning we
see in what respect it differs from a pledge on the one hand
and a mortgage on the other. It is the bond which attaches
a creditor&rsquo;s right to a debtor&rsquo;s property, but which gives no right
<i>ad rem</i>, <i>i.e.</i> to property in the thing; if the property is in the
possession of the creditor he may retain it, but in the absence
of statute he cannot sell to recover what is due to him without
the ordinary legal process against the debtor; and if it is not
in possession, the law would indeed assist him to seize the
property, and will hold it for him, and enable him to sell it in
due course and pay himself out of the proceeds, but does not
give him the property itself. It is difficult to say at what
period the term lien made its appearance in English law; it
probably came from more than one source. In fact, it was used
as a convenient phrase for any right against the owner of property
in regard to the property not specially defined by other better
recognized species of title.</p>

<p>The possessory lien of a tradesman for work done on the thing,
of a carrier for his hire, and of an innkeeper for his bill, would
seem to be an inherent right which must have been in existence
from the dawn, or before the dawn, of civilization. Probably
the man who made or repaired weapons in the Stone Age was
careful not to deliver them until he received what was stipulated
for, but it is also probable that the term itself resulted from
the infusion of the civil law of Rome into the common law of
England which the Norman Conquest brought about, and that
it represents the &ldquo;tacit pledge&rdquo; of the civil law. As might
be expected, so far as the possessory lien is concerned the common
law and civil law, and probably the laws of all countries, whether
civilized or not, coincide; but there are many differences with
respect to other species of lien. For instance, by the common
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page595" id="page595"></a>595</span>
law&mdash;in this respect a legacy of the feudal system&mdash;a landlord
has a lien over his tenant&rsquo;s furniture and effects for rent due,
which can be enforced without the assistance of the law simply
by the landlord taking possession, personally or by his agent,
and selling enough to satisfy his claim; whereas the maritime
lien is more distinctly the product of the civil law, and is only
found and used in admiralty proceedings, the high court of
admiralty having been founded upon the civil law, and still
(except so far as restrained by the common-law courts prior
to the amalgamation and co-ordination of the various courts
by the Judicature Acts, and as affected by statute law) acting
upon it. The peculiar effects of this maritime lien are discussed
below. There is also a class of liens, usually called equitable
liens (<i>e.g.</i> that of an unpaid vendor of real property over the
property sold), which are akin to the nature of the civil law
rather than of the common law. The word lien does not frequently
occur in statute law, but it is found in the extension of the
common-law &ldquo;carriers&rsquo; or shipowners&rsquo; lien&rdquo; in the Merchant
Shipping Act 1894; in the definition, extension and limitation
of the vendor&rsquo;s lien; in the Factors Act 1877, and the Sale
of Goods Act 1893; in granting a maritime lien to a shipmaster
for his wages and disbursements, and in regulating that of the
seamen in the Merchant Shipping Act 1894; and in the equity
jurisdiction of the county courts 1888.</p>

<p><i>Common-Law Liens.</i>&mdash;These may be either particular, <i>i.e.</i>
a right over one or more specified articles for a particular debt,
or general, <i>i.e.</i> for all debts owing to the creditor by the debtor.</p>

<p>The requisites for a particular lien are, firstly, that the creditor
should be in possession of the article; secondly, that the debt
should be incurred with reference to the article; and thirdly,
that the amount of the debt should be certain. It may be created
by express contract, by implied contract (such as the usage of a
particular trade or business), or as a consequence of the legal
relation existing between the parties. As an example of the first,
a shipowner at common law has a lien on the cargo for the
freight; but though the shipper agrees to pay dead freight in
addition, <i>i.e.</i> to pay freight on any space in the ship which he
fails to occupy with his cargo, the shipowner has no lien on the
cargo for such dead freight except by express agreement. The
most usual form of the second is that which is termed a possessory
lien&mdash;the right a ship-repairer has to retain a ship in his yard
till he is paid for the repairs executed upon her,<a name="fa1m" id="fa1m" href="#ft1m"><span class="sp">1</span></a> and the right a
cobbler has to retain a pair of shoes till he is paid for the repairs
done to them. But this lien is only in respect of the work done
on, and consequent benefit received by, the subject of the lien.
Hence an agistor of cattle has no lien at common law upon them
for the value of the pasturage consumed, though he may have one
by agreement; nor a conveyancer upon deeds which he has not
drawn, but which are in his possession for reference. The most
common example of the third is that of a carrier, who is bound by
law to carry for all persons, and has, therefore, a lien for the price
of the carriage on the goods carried. It has been held that even
if the goods are stolen, and entrusted to the carrier by the thief,
the carrier can hold them for the price of the carriage against the
rightful owner. Of the same nature is the common-law lien of an
innkeeper on the baggage of his customer for the amount of his
account, he being under a legal obligation to entertain travellers
generally. Another instance of the same class is where a person
has obtained possession of certain things over which he claims
to hold a lien in the exercise of a legal right. For example,
when a lord of a manor has seized cattle as estrays, he has a lien
upon them for the expense of their keep as against the real
owner; but the holder&rsquo;s claim must be specific, otherwise a
general tender of compensation releases the lien.</p>

<p>A general lien is a right of a creditor to retain property, not
merely for charges relating to it specifically, but for debts due
on a general account. This not being a common-law right, is
viewed by the English courts with the greatest jealousy, and to be
enforced must be strictly proved. This can be done by proof
either of an express or implied contract or of a general usage of
trade. The first of these is established by the ordinary methods
or by previous dealings between the parties on such terms; the
second is recognized in certain businesses; it would probably be
exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to extend it at the present
time to any other trades. When, however, a lien by general
usage has once been judicially established, it becomes part of
the Law Merchant, and the courts are bound to recognize and
enforce it. The best known and most important instance is
the right of a solicitor to retain papers in his hands belonging to
his client until his account is settled. The solicitor&rsquo;s lien,
though probably more commonly enforced than any other, is of
no great antiquity in English law, the earliest reported case
of it being in the reign of James II.; but it is now of a twofold
nature. In the first place there is the retaining lien. This
is similar in kind to other possessory liens, but of a general
nature attaching to all papers of the client, and even to his
money, up to the amount of the solicitor&rsquo;s bill, in the hands of
the solicitor in the ordinary course of business. There are certain
exceptions which seem to have crept in for the same reason as
the solicitor&rsquo;s lien itself, <i>i.e.</i> general convenience of litigation;
such exceptions are the will of the client after his decease, and
proceedings in bankruptcy. In this latter case the actual
possessory lien is given up, the solicitor&rsquo;s interests and priorities
being protected by the courts, and it may be said that the giving
up the papers is really only a means of enforcing the lien they
give in the bankruptcy proceedings. In the second place
there is what is called a charging lien&mdash;more correctly classed
under the head of equitable lien, since it does not require possession,
but is a lien the solicitor holds over property recovered or
preserved for his client. He had the lien on an order by the court
upon a fund in court by the common law, but as to property
generally it was only given by 23 &amp; 24 Vict. c. 127, § 28; and
it has been held to attach to property recovered in a probate
action (<i>ex parte Tweed</i>, C.A. 1899, 2 Q.B. 167). A banker&rsquo;s lien
is the right of a banker to retain securities belonging to his
customer for money due on a general balance. Other general
liens, judicially established, are those of wharfingers, brokers and
factors (which are in their nature akin to those of solicitors and
bankers), and of calico printers, packers of goods, fullers (at all
events at Exeter), dyers and millers; but in all these special
trades it is probable that the true reason is that the account
due was for one continuous transaction. The calico would
come to be printed, the goods to be packed, the cloth to be
bleached, the silk to be dyed, and the corn to be ground, in
separate parcels, and at different times, but all as one undertaking;
and they are therefore, though spoken of as instances of
general lien, only adaptations by the courts of the doctrine of
particular lien to special peculiarities of business. In none of
these cases would the lien exist, in the absence of special agreement,
for other matters of account, such as money lent or goods
sold.</p>

<p><i>Equitable Liens.</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Where equity has jurisdiction to enforce
rights and obligations growing out of an executory contract,&rdquo;
<i>e.g.</i> in a suit for specific performance, &ldquo;this equitable theory of
remedies cannot be carried out unless the notion is admitted
that the contract creates some right or interest in or over specific
property, which the decree of the court can lay hold of, and
by means of which the equitable relief can be made efficient.
The doctrine of equitable liens supplies this necessary element;
and it was introduced for the sole purpose of furnishing a ground
for these specific remedies which equity confers, operating upon
particular identified property instead of the general pecuniary
recoveries granted by courts of common law. It follows, therefore,
that in a large class of executory contracts express and implied,
which the common law regards as creating no property, right
nor interest analogous to property, but only a mere personal
right to obligation, equity recognizes in addition to the personal
obligation a particular right over the thing with which the contract
deals, which it calls a <i>lien</i>, and which though not property is
analogous to property, and by means of which the plaintiff is
enabled to follow the identical thing and to enforce the defendant&rsquo;s
obligation by a remedy which operates directly on the thing.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page596" id="page596"></a>596</span>
The theory of equitable liens has its ultimate foundation,
therefore, in contracts express or implied which either deal or
in some manner relate to specific property, such as a tract of
land, particular chattels or securities, a certain fund and the
like. It is necessary to divest oneself of the purely legal notion
concerning the effects of such contracts, and to recognize the
fact that equity regards them as creating a charge upon, or
hypothecation of, the specific thing, by means of which the
personal obligation arising from the agreement may be more
effectively enforced than by a mere pecuniary recovery at
law&rdquo; (Pomeroy, 2 Eq. Jur. 232).</p>

<p>This description from an American text-book seems to give
at once the fullest and most concise definition and description
of an equitable lien. It differs essentially from a common-law
lien, inasmuch as in the latter possession or occupation is as a
rule necessary, whereas in the equitable lien the person claiming
the lien is seldom in possession or occupation of the property,
its object being to obtain the possession wholly or partially.
A special instance of such a lien is that claimed by a publisher
over the copyright of a book which he has agreed to publish
on terms which are not complied with&mdash;for example, the author
attempting to get the book published elsewhere. It cannot
perhaps be said that this has been absolutely decided to exist,
but a strong opinion of the English court of exchequer towards
the close of the 18th century was expressed in its favour (<i>Brook</i>
v. <i>Wentworth</i>, 3 Anstruther 881). Other instances are the
charging lien of a solicitor, and the lien of a person on improvements
effected by him on the property of another who &ldquo;lies
by&rdquo; and allows the work to be done before claiming the property.
So also of a trustee for expenses lawfully incurred about the
trust property. The power of a limited liability company to
create a lien upon its own shares was in 1901 established (<i>Allen</i>
v. <i>Gold Reefs, &amp;c.</i>, C.A. 1900, 1 Ch. 656).</p>

<p><i>Maritime Liens.</i>&mdash;Maritime lien differs from all the others
yet considered, in its more elastic nature. Where a maritime
lien has once attached to property&mdash;and it may and generally
does attach without possession&mdash;it will continue to attach,
unless lost by laches, so long as the thing to which it attaches
exists, notwithstanding changes in the possession of and property
in the thing, and notwithstanding that the new possessor
or owner may be entirely ignorant of its existence; and even
if enforced it leaves the owner&rsquo;s personal liability for any balance
unrealized intact (the &ldquo;<i>Gemma</i>,&rdquo; 1899, P. 285). So far as England
is concerned, it must be borne in mind that the courts of admiralty
were conducted in accordance with the principles of civil law,
and in that law both the pledge with possession and the hypothecation
without possession were well recognized. The extreme
convenience of such a right as the latter with regard to such
essentially movable chattels as ships is apparent. Strictly
speaking, a maritime lien is confined to cases arising in those
matters over which the courts of admiralty had original jurisdiction,
viz. collisions at sea, seamen&rsquo;s wages, salvage and
bottomry, in all of which cases the appropriate remedy is a
proceeding <i>in rem</i> in the admiralty court. In the first of these&mdash;collisions
at sea&mdash;if there were no maritime lien there would
frequently be no remedy at all. When two ships have collided
at sea it may well be that the innocent ship knows neither the
name nor the nationality of the wrongdoer, and the vessel
may escape with slight damage and not have to make a port
of refuge in the neighbourhood. Months afterwards it is ascertained
that she was a foreign ship, and in the interval she has
changed owners. Then, were it not a fact that a maritime
lien invisible to the wrongdoer nevertheless attaches itself to
his ship at the moment of collision, and continues to attach,
the unfortunate owner of the innocent ship would have no
remedy, except the doubtful one of pursuing the former owner
of the wrong-doing vessel in his own country in a personal
action where such proceedings are allowed&mdash;which is by no means
the case in all foreign countries. The same reasons apply,
though not possibly with quite the same force, to the other
classes of cases mentioned.</p>

<p>Between 1840 and 1873 the jurisdiction of the admiralty
court was largely extended. At the latter date it was merged
in the probate, divorce and admiralty division of the High Court
of Justice. Since the merger questions have arisen as to how
far the enlargement of jurisdiction has extended the principle
of maritime lien. An interesting article on this subject by J.
Mansfield, barrister-at-law, will be found in the <i>Law Quarterly
Review</i>, vol. iv., October 1888. It must be sufficient to state
here that where legislation has extended the already existing
jurisdiction to which a maritime lien pertained, the maritime
lien is extended to the subject matter, but that where a new
jurisdiction is given, or where a jurisdiction formerly existing
without a maritime lien is extended, no maritime lien is given,
though even then the extended jurisdiction can be enforced
by proceedings <i>in rem</i>. Of the first class of extended jurisdictions
are collisions, salvage and seamen&rsquo;s wages. Prior to 1840 the
court of admiralty only had jurisdiction over these when occurring
or earned on the high seas. The jurisdiction, and with it the
maritime lien, is extended to places within the body of a county
in collision or salvage; and as to seamen&rsquo;s wages, whereas they
were dependent on the earning of freight, they are now free
from any such limitation; and also, whereas the remedy <i>in rem</i>
was limited to seamen&rsquo;s wages not earned under a special contract,
it is now extended to all seamen&rsquo;s wages, and also to a
master&rsquo;s wages and disbursements, and the maritime lien
covers all these. The new jurisdiction given over claims for
damage to cargo carried into any port in England or Wales,
and on appeal from the county courts over all claims for damage
to cargo under £300, though it may be prosecuted by proceedings
<i>in rem</i>, <i>i.e.</i> by arrest of the ship, yet confers no maritime lien;
and so also in the case of claims by material men (builders and
fitters-out of ships) and for necessaries. Even though in the
latter case the admiralty court had jurisdiction previously to
1840 where the necessaries were supplied on the high seas,
yet as it could not be shown that such jurisdiction had ever
been held to confer a maritime lien, no such lien is given. Even
now there is much doubt as to whether towage confers a maritime
lien or not, the services rendered being pursuant to contract,
and frequently to a contract made verbally or in writing on
the high seas, and being rendered also to a great extent on the
high seas. In these cases and to that extent the high court of
admiralty would have had original jurisdiction. But prior to
1840 towage, as now rendered by steam tugs expressly employed
for the service, was practically unknown, and therefore there was
no established catena of precedent to show the exercise of a
maritime lien. It may be argued on the one hand that towage
is only a modified form of salvage, and therefore entitled to a
maritime lien, and on the other that it is only a form of necessary
power supplied like a new sail or mast to a ship to enable her
to complete her voyage expeditiously, and therefore of the
nature of necessaries, and as such not entitled to a maritime
lien. The matter is not of academical interest only, for though
in the case of an inward-bound ship the tug owner can make use
of his statutory right of proceeding <i>in rem</i>, and so obtain much
of the benefit of a maritime lien, yet in the case of an outward-bound
ship, if she once gets away without payment, and the agent
or other authorized person refuses or is unable to pay, the tug
owner&rsquo;s claim may, on the return of the ship to a British port,
be met by an allegation of a change of ownership, which defeats
his right of proceeding at all if he has no maritime lien; whereas
if he has a maritime lien he can still proceed against the ship
and recover his claim, if he has not been guilty of laches.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>A convenient division of the special liens other than possessory
on ships may be made by classifying them as maritime, statutory-maritime
or quasi-maritime, and statutory. The first attach only
in the case of damage done by collision between ships on the high
seas, salvage on the high seas, bottomry and seamen&rsquo;s wages so
far as freight has been earned; the second attach in cases of damage
by collision within the body of a county, salvage within the body of
a county, life salvage everywhere, seamen&rsquo;s wages even if no freight
has been earned, master&rsquo;s wages and disbursements. These two
classes continue to attach notwithstanding a change of ownership
without notice of the lien, if there have been no laches in enforcing
it (the &ldquo;<i>Bold Buccleuch</i>,&rdquo; 1852, 7 Moo. P.C. 267; the &ldquo;<i>Kong Magnus</i>,&rdquo;
1891, P. 223). The third class, which only give a right to proceed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page597" id="page597"></a>597</span>
<i>in rem</i>, <i>i.e.</i> against the ship itself, attach, so long as there is no
<i>bona fide</i> change of ownership, without citing the owners, in all
cases of claims for damage to ship and of claims for damage to
cargo where no owner is domiciled in England or Wales. Irrespective
of this limitation, they attach in all cases not only of damage to
cargo, but also of breaches of contract to carry where the damage
does not exceed £300, when the suit must be commenced in a county
court having admiralty jurisdiction; and in cases of claims for
necessaries supplied elsewhere than in the ship&rsquo;s home port, for
wages earned even under a special contract by masters and mariners,
and of claims for towage. In all three classes the lien also exists
over cargo where the suit from its nature extends to it, as in salvage
and in some cases of bottomry or respondentia, and in cases where
proceedings are taken against cargo by the shipowner for a breach
of contract (cargo <i>ex</i> &ldquo;<i>Argos</i>&rdquo; and the &ldquo;<i>Hewsons</i>,&rdquo; 1873, L.R. 5 P.C.
134; the &ldquo;<i>Alina</i>,&rdquo; 1880, 5 Ex. D. 227).</p>

<p>Elsewhere than in England, and those countries such as the
United States which have adopted her jurisprudence in maritime
matters generally, the doctrine of maritime lien, or that which is
substituted for it, is very differently treated. Speaking generally,
those states which have adopted the Napoleonic codes or modifications
of them&mdash;France, Italy, Spain, Holland, Portugal, Belgium,
Greece, Turkey, and to some extent Russia&mdash;have instead of a
maritime lien the civil-law principle of privileged debts. Amongst
these in all cases are found claims for salvage, wages, bottomry
under certain restrictions, and necessaries. Each of these has a
privileged claim against the ship, and in some cases against freight
and cargo as well, but it is a matter of very great importance that,
except in Belgium, a claim for collision damage (which as we have
seen confers a maritime lien, and one of a very high order, in Great
Britain) confers no privilege against the wrong-doing ship, whilst
in all these countries an owner can get rid of his personal liability
by abandoning the ship and freight to his creditor, and so, if the
ship is sunk, escape all liability whilst retaining any insurance
there may be. This, indeed, was at one time the law of Great
Britain; the measure of damage was limited by the value of the
<i>res</i>; and in the United States at the present time a shipowner can
get rid of his liability for damage by abandoning the ship and freight.
A different rule prevails in Germany and the Scandinavian states.
There claims relating to the ship, unless the owner has specially
rendered himself liable, confer no personal claim at all against him.
The claim is limited <i>ab initio</i> to ship and freight, except in the case
of seamen&rsquo;s wages, which do confer a personal claim so far as they
have been earned on a voyage or passage completed prior to the loss
of the ship. In all maritime states, however, except Spain, a provisional
arrest of the ship is allowed, and thus between the privilege
accorded to the debt and the power to arrest till bail is given or the
ship abandoned to creditors, a condition of things analogous to the
maritime lien is established; especially as these claims when the
proper legal steps have been taken to render them valid&mdash;usually
by endorsement on the ship&rsquo;s papers on board, or by registration
at her port of registry&mdash;attach to the ship and follow her into the
hands of a purchaser. They are in fact notice to him of the incumbrance.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Duration of Lien.</i>&mdash;So long as the party claiming the lien
at common law retains the property, the lien continues, notwithstanding
the debt in respect of which it is claimed becoming
barred by the Statute of Limitations (<i>Higgins</i> v. <i>Scott</i>, 1831,
2 B. &amp; Ald. 413). But if he takes proceedings at law to recover
the debt, and on a sale of the goods to satisfy the judgment
purchases them himself, he so alters the nature of the possession
that he loses his lien (<i>Jacobs</i> v. <i>Latour</i>, 5 Bing. 130). An equitable
lien probably in all cases continues, provided the purchaser
of the subject matter has notice of the lien at the time of his
purchase. A maritime lien is in no respect subject to the Statute
of Limitations, and continues in force notwithstanding a change
in the ownership of the property without notice, and is only
terminated when it has once attached, by laches on the part
of the person claiming it (the &ldquo;<i>Kong Magnus</i>,&rdquo; 1891, P. 223).
There is an exception in the case of seamen&rsquo;s wages, where by
4 Anne c. 16 (<i>Stat. Rev.</i> 4 &amp; 5 Anne c. 3) all suits for seamen&rsquo;s
wages in the Admiralty must be brought within six years.</p>

<p><i>Ranking of Maritime Liens.</i>&mdash;There may be several claimants
holding maritime and other liens on the same vessel. For
example, a foreign vessel comes into collision by her own fault
and is damaged and her cargo also; she is assisted into port
by salvors and ultimately under a towage agreement, and
put into the hands of a shipwright who does necessary repairs.
The innocent party to the collision has a maritime lien for
his damage, and the seamen for their wages; the cargo owner
has a suit <i>in rem</i> or a statutory lien for damage, and the shipwright
a possessory lien for the value of his repairs, while the
tugs certainly have a right <i>in rem</i> and possibly a maritime lien
also in the nature of salvage. The value of the property may
be insufficient to pay all claims, and it becomes a matter of great
consequence to settle whether any, and if so which, have priority
over the others, or whether all rank alike and have to divide
the proceeds of the property <i>pro ratâ</i> amongst them. The
following general rules apply: liens for benefits conferred
rank against the fund in the inverse, and those for the reparation
of damage sustained in the direct order of their attaching to the
<i>res</i>; as between the two classes those last mentioned rank before
those first mentioned of earlier date; as between liens of the
same class and the same date, the first claimant has priority
over others who have not taken action. The courts of admiralty,
however, allow equitable considerations, and enter into the
question of marshalling assets. For example, if one claimant
has a lien on two funds, or an effective right of action in addition
to his lien, and another claimant has only a lien upon one fund,
the first claimant will be obliged to exhaust his second remedy
before coming into competition with the second. As regards
possessory liens, the shipwright takes the ship as she stands,
<i>i.e.</i> with her incumbrances, and it appears that the lien for
seaman&rsquo;s wages takes precedence of a solicitor&rsquo;s lien for costs,
under a charging order made in pursuance of the Solicitors
Act 1860, § 28.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Subject to equitable considerations, the true principle appears
to be that services rendered under an actual or implied contract,
which confer a maritime lien, make the holder of the lien in some
sort a proprietor of the vessel, and therefore liable for damage done
by her&mdash;hence the priority of the damage lien&mdash;but, directly it has
attached, benefits conferred on the property by enabling it to reach
port in safety benefit the holder of the damage lien in common with
all other prior holders of maritime liens. It is less easy to see why of
two damage liens the earlier should take precedence of the later,
except on the principle that the <i>res</i> which came into collision the
second time is depreciated in value by the amount of the existing
lien upon her for the first collision, and where there was more than
one damage lien, and also liens for benefits conferred prior to
the first collision between the two collisions and subsequent to the
second, the court would have to make a special order to meet the
peculiar circumstances. The claim of a mortgagee naturally is
deferred to all maritime liens, whether they are for benefits conferred
on the property in which he is interested or for damage done by it,
and also for the same reason to the possessory lien of the shipwright,
but both the possessory lien of the shipwright and the claim of the
mortgagee take precedence over a claim for necessaries, which only
confers a statutory lien or a right to proceed <i>in rem</i> in certain cases.
In other maritime states possessing codes of commercial law, the
privileged debts are all set out in order of priority in these codes,
though, as has been already pointed out, the lien for damage by
collision&mdash;the most important in English law&mdash;has no counterpart
in most of the foreign codes.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Stoppage in Transitu</i>.&mdash;This is a lien held by an unpaid
vendor in certain cases over goods sold after they have passed
out of his actual possession. It has been much discussed whether
it is an equitable or common-law right or lien. The fact appears
to be that it has always been a part of the Law Merchant, which,
properly speaking, is itself a part of the common law of England
unless inconsistent with it. This particular right was, in the
first instance, held by a court of equity to be equitable and not
contrary to English law, and by that decision this particular
part of the Law Merchant was approved and became part of
the common law of England (see per Lord Abinger in <i>Gibson</i>
v. <i>Carruthers</i>, 8 M. &amp; W., p. 336 et seq.). It may be described
as a lien by the Law Merchant, decided by equity to be part
of the common law, but in its nature partaking rather of the
character of an equitable lien than one at common law. &ldquo;It
is a right which arises solely upon the insolvency of the buyer,
and is based on the plain reason of justice and equity that one
man&rsquo;s goods shall not be applied to the payment of another
man&rsquo;s debts. If, therefore, after the vendor has delivered the
goods out of his own possession and put them in the hands
of a carrier for delivery to the buyer, he discovers that the
buyer is insolvent, he may re-take the goods if he can before
they reach the buyer&rsquo;s possession, and thus avoid having his
property applied to paying debts due by the buyer to other
people&rdquo; (<i>Benjamin on Sales</i>, 2nd ed., 289). This right, though
only recognized by English law in 1690, is highly favoured by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page598" id="page598"></a>598</span>
the courts on account of its intrinsic justice, and extends to
quasi-vendors, or persons in the same position, such as consignors
who have bought on behalf of a principal and forwarded the
goods. It is, however, defeated by a lawful transfer of the document
of title to the goods by the vendor to a third person, who
takes it <i>bonâ fide</i> and for valuable consideration (Factors Act
1889; Sale of Goods Act 1893).</p>

<p><i>Assignment or Transfer of Lien</i>.&mdash;A lien being a personal
right acquired in respect of personal services, it cannot, as
a rule, be assigned or transferred; but here again there are
exceptions. The personal representative of the holder of
a possessory lien on his decease would probably in all cases
be held entitled to it; and it has been held that the lien over a
client&rsquo;s papers remains with the firm of solicitors notwithstanding
changes in the constitution of the firm (<i>Gregory</i> v. <i>Cresswell</i>,
14 L.J. Ch. 300). So also where a solicitor, having a lien on
documents for his costs, assigned the debt to his bankers with
the benefit of the lien, it was held that the bankers might enforce
such lien in equity. But though a tradesman has a lien on
the property of his customer for his charges for work done
upon it, where the property is delivered to him by a servant
acting within the scope of his employment, such lien cannot
be transferred to the servant, even if he has paid the money
himself; and the lien does not exist at all if the servant was
acting without authority in delivering the goods, except where
(as in the case of a common carrier) he is bound to receive
the goods, in which case he retains his lien for the carriage
against the rightful owner. Where, however, there is a lien
on property of any sort not in possession, a person acquiring
the property with knowledge of the lien takes it subject to
such lien. This applies to equitable liens, and cannot apply
to those common-law liens in which possession is necessary.
It is, however, true that by statute certain common-law liens
can be transferred, <i>e.g.</i> under the Merchant Shipping Act a
master of a ship having a lien upon cargo for his freight can
transfer the possession of the cargo to a wharfinger, and with
it the lien (Merchant Shipping Act 1894, § 494). In this case,
however, though the matter is simplified by the statute, if the
wharfinger was constituted the agent or servant of the shipmaster,
his possession would be the possession of the shipmaster,
and there would be no real transfer of the lien; therefore the
common-law doctrine is not altered, only greater facilities
for the furtherance of trade are given by the statute, enabling
the wharfinger to act in his own name without reference to
his principal, who may be at the other side of the world. So
also a lien may be retained, notwithstanding that the property
passes out of possession, where it has to be deposited in some
special place (such as the Custom-House) to comply with the
law. Seamen cannot sell or assign or in any way part with
their maritime lien for wages (Merchant Shipping Act 1894,
§ 156), but, nevertheless, with the sanction of the court, a person
who pays seamen their wages is entitled to stand in their place
and exercise their rights (the <i>Cornelia Henrietta</i>, 1866, L.R.
1 Ad. &amp; Ec. 51).</p>

<p><i>Waiver</i>.&mdash;Any parting with the possession of goods is in
general a waiver of the lien upon them; for example, when a
factor having a lien on the goods of his principal gives them to a
carrier to be carried at the expense of his principal, even if
undisclosed, he waives his lien, and has no right to stop the goods
<i>in transitu</i> to recover it; so also where a coach-builder who has
a lien on a carriage for repairs allows the owner from time to
time to take it out for use without expressly reserving his lien,
he has waived it, nor has he a lien for the standage of the carriage
except by express agreement, as mere standage does not give a
possessory lien. It has even been held that where a portion of
goods sold as a whole for a lump sum has been taken away and
paid for proportionately, the conversion has taken place and the
lien for the residue of the unpaid purchase-money has gone
(<i>Gurr</i> v. <i>Cuthbert</i>, 1843, 12 L.J. Ex. 309). Again, an acceptance
of security for a debt is inconsistent with the existence of a lien,
as it substitutes the credit of the owner for the material guarantee
of the thing itself, and so acts as a waiver of the lien. For the
same reason even an agreement to take security is a waiver of
the lien, though the security is not, in fact, given (<i>Alliance Bank</i>
v. <i>Broon</i>, 11 L.T. 332).</p>

<p><i>Sale of Goods under Lien.</i>&mdash;At common law the lien only gives
a right to retain the goods, and ultimately to sell by legal process,
against the owner; but in certain cases a right has been given
by statute to sell without the intervention of legal process, such
as the right of an innkeeper to sell the goods of his customer for
his unpaid account (Innkeepers Act 1878, § 1), the right of a
wharfinger to sell goods entrusted to him by a shipowner with
a lien upon them for freight, and also for their own charges
(Merchant Shipping Act 1894, §§ 497, 498), and of a railway
company to sell goods for their charges (Railway Clauses Act
1845, § 97). Property affected by an equitable lien or a maritime
lien cannot be sold by the holder of the lien without the interposition
of the court to enforce an order, or judgment of the
court. In Admiralty cases, where a sale is necessary, no bail
having been given and the property being under arrest, the
sale is usually made by the marshal in London, but may be
elsewhere on the parties concerned showing that a better price
is likely to be obtained.</p>

<p><span class="sc">American Law.</span>&mdash;In the United States, speaking very generally,
the law relating to liens is that of England, but there are
some considerable differences occasioned by three principal
causes. (1) Some of the Southern States, notably Louisiana,
have never adopted the common law of England. When that
state became one of the United States of North America it had
(and still preserves) its own system of law. In this respect the
law is practically identical with the Code Napoleon, which,
again speaking generally, substitutes privileges for liens, <i>i.e.</i>
gives certain claims a prior right to others against particular
property. These privileges being <i>strictissimae interpretationis</i>,
cannot be extended by any principle analogous to the English
doctrine of equitable liens. (2) Probably in consequence of the
United States and the several states composing it having had a
more democratic government than Great Britain, in their earlier
years at all events, certain liens have been created by statute
in several states in the interest of the working classes which have
no parallel in Great Britain, <i>e.g.</i> in some states workmen
employed in building a house or a ship have a lien upon the
building or structure itself for their unpaid wages. This statutory
lien partakes rather of the nature of an equitable than of a
common-law lien, as the property is not in the possession of the
workman, and it may be doubted whether the right thus conferred
is more beneficial to the workman than the priority his wages
have in bankruptcy proceedings in England. Some of the states
have also practically extended the maritime lien to matters
over which it was never contended for in England. (3) By the
constitution of the United States the admiralty and inter-state
jurisdiction is vested in the federal as distinguished from the
state courts, and these federal courts have not been liable to
have their jurisdiction curtailed by prohibition from courts of
common law, as the court of admiralty had in England up to the
time of the Judicature Acts; consequently the maritime lien
in the United States extends further than it does in England,
even after recent enlargements; it covers claims for necessaries
and by material men (see <i>Maritime Lien</i>), as well as collision,
salvage, wages, bottomry and damage to cargo.</p>

<p>Difficulties connected with lien occasionally arise in the
federal courts in admiralty cases, from a conflict on the subject
between the municipal law of the state where the court happens
to sit and the admiralty law; but as there is no power to prohibit
the federal court, its view of the admiralty law based on the
civil law prevails. More serious difficulties arise where a federal
court has to try inter-state questions, where the two states have
different laws on the subject of lien; one for example, like
Louisiana, following the civil law, and the other the common
law and equitable practice of Great Britain. The question as
to which law is to govern in such a case can hardly be said to be
decided. &ldquo;The question whether equitable liens can exist to
be enforced in Louisiana by the federal courts, notwithstanding
its restrictive law of privileges, is still an open one&rdquo; (Derris,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page599" id="page599"></a>599</span>
<i>Contracts of Pledge</i>, 517; and see <i>Burdon Sugar Refining Co.</i> v.
<i>Payne</i>, 167 U.S. 127).</p>

<p><span class="sc">British Colonies.</span>&mdash;In those colonies which before the
Canadian federation were known as Upper Canada and the
Maritime Provinces of British North America, and in the several
Australasian states where the English common law is enforced
except as modified by colonial statute, the principles of lien,
whether by common law or equitable or maritime, discussed
above with reference to England, will prevail; but questions
not dissimilar to those treated of in reference to the United States
may arise where colonies have come to the crown of Great
Britain by cession, and where different systems of municipal
law are enforced. For example, in Lower Canada the law of
France prior to the Revolution occupies the place of the common
law in England, but is generally regulated by a code very similar
to the Code Napoleon; in Mauritius and its dependencies the
Code Napoleon itself is in force except so far as modified by
subsequent ordinances. In South Africa, and to some extent
in Ceylon and Guiana, Roman-Dutch law is in force; in the
island of Trinidad old Spanish law, prior to the introduction of
the present civil code of Spain, is the basis of jurisprudence.
Each several system of law requires to be studied on the point;
but, speaking generally, apart from the possessory lien of workmen
and the maritime lien of the vice-admiralty courts, it may be
assumed that the rules of the civil law, giving a privilege or
priority in certain specified cases rather than a lien as understood
in English law, prevail in those colonies where the English
law is not in force.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIEUTENANT,<a name="ar125" id="ar125"></a></span> one who takes the place, office and duty of
and acts on behalf of a superior or other person. The word
in English preserves the form of the French original (from <i>lieu</i>,
place, <i>tenant</i>, holding), which is the equivalent of the Lat.
<i>locum tenens</i>, one holding the place of another. The usual
English pronunciation appears early, the word being frequently
spelled <i>lieftenant</i>, <i>lyeftenant</i> or <i>luftenant</i> in the 14th and 15th
centuries. The modern American pronunciation is <i>lewtenant</i>,
while the German is represented by the present form of the
word <i>Leutnant</i>. In French history, <i>lieutenant du roi</i> (<i>locum
tenens regis</i>) was a title borne by the officer sent with military
powers to represent the king in certain provinces. With wider
powers and functions, both civil as well as military, and holding
authority throughout an entire province, such a representative
of the king was called <i>lieutenant général du roi</i>. The first appointment
of these officials dates from the reign of Philip IV. the
Fair (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Constable</a></span>). In the 16th century the administration
of the provinces was in the hands of <i>gouverneurs</i>, to whom the
<i>lieutenants du roi</i> became subordinates. The titles <i>lieutenant
civil</i> or <i>criminel</i> and <i>lieutenant général de police</i> have been borne
by certain judicial officers in France (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Châtelet</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Bailiff</a></span>:
<i>Bailli</i>). As the title of the representative of the sovereign,
&ldquo;lieutenant&rdquo; in English usage appears in the title of the lord
lieutenant of Ireland, and of the lords lieutenant of the counties
of the United Kingdom (see below).</p>

<p>The most general use of the word is as the name of a grade
of naval and military officer. It is common in this application
to nearly every navy and army of the present day. In Italy and
Spain the first part of the word is omitted, and an Italian and
Spanish officer bearing this rank are called <i>tenente</i> or <i>teniente</i>
respectively. In the British and most other navies the lieutenants
are the commissioned officers next in rank to commanders,
or second class of captains. Originally the lieutenant
was a soldier who aided, and in case of need replaced, the captain,
who, until the latter half of the 17th century, was not necessarily
a seaman in any navy. At first one lieutenant was carried, and
only in the largest ships. The number was gradually increased,
and the lieutenants formed a numerous corps. At the close
of the Napoleonic War in 1815 there were 3211 lieutenants in the
British navy. Lieutenants now often qualify for special duties
such as navigation, or gunnery, or the management of torpedoes.
In the British army a lieutenant is a subaltern officer ranking
next below a captain and above a second lieutenant. In
the United States of America subalterns are classified as first
lieutenants and second lieutenants. In France the two grades
are <i>lieutenant</i> and <i>sous-lieutenant</i>, while in Germany the <i>Leutnant</i>
is the lower of the two ranks, the higher being <i>Ober-leutnant</i>
(formerly <i>Premier-leutnant</i>). A &ldquo;captain lieutenant&rdquo; in the
British army was formerly the senior subaltern who virtually
commanded the colonel&rsquo;s company or troop, and ranked as
junior captain, or &ldquo;puny captain,&rdquo; as he was called by Cromwell&rsquo;s
soldiers.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The lord lieutenant of a county, in England and Wales and in
Ireland, is the principal officer of a county. His creation dates from
the reign of Henry VIII. (or, according to some, Edward VI.), when
the military functions of the sheriff were handed over to him. He
was responsible for the efficiency of the militia of the county, and
afterwards of the yeomanry and volunteers. He was commander
of these forces, whose officers he appointed. By the Regulation of
the Forces Act 1871, the jurisdiction, duties and command exercised
by the lord lieutenant were revested in the crown, but the power of
recommending for first appointments was reserved to the lord
lieutenant. By the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907, the
lord lieutenant of a county was constituted president of the county
association. The office of lord lieutenant is honorary, and is held
during the royal pleasure, but virtually for life. Appointment to the
office is by letters patent under the great seal. Usually, though not
necessarily, the person appointed lord lieutenant is also appointed
custos rotulorum (<i>q.v.</i>). Appointments to the county bench of
magistrates are usually made on the recommendation of the lord
lieutenant (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Justice of the Peace</a></span>).</p>

<p>A deputy lieutenant (denoted frequently by the addition of the
letters D.L. after a person&rsquo;s name) is a deputy of a lord lieutenant
of a county. His appointment and qualifications previous to 1908
were regulated by the Militia Act 1882. By s. 30 of that act the
lieutenant of each county was required from time to time to appoint
such properly qualified persons as he thought fit, living within the
county, to be deputy lieutenants. At least twenty had to be appointed
for each county, if there were so many qualified; if less than
that number were qualified, then all the duly qualified persons in
the county were to be appointed. The appointments were subject
to the sovereign&rsquo;s approval, and a return of all appointments to,
and removals from, the office had to be laid before parliament
annually. To qualify for the appointment of deputy lieutenant a
person had to be (<i>a</i>) a peer of the realm, or the heir-apparent of such
a peer, having a place of residence within the county; or (<i>b</i>) have in
possession an estate in land in the United Kingdom of the yearly
value of not less than £200; or (<i>c</i>) be the heir-apparent of such a
person; or (<i>d</i>) have a clear yearly income from personalty within
the United Kingdom of not less than £200 (s. 33). If the lieutenant
were absent from the United Kingdom, or through illness or other
cause were unable to act, the sovereign might authorize any three
deputy lieutenants to act as lieutenant (s. 31), or might appoint a
deputy lieutenant to act as vice-lieutenant. Otherwise, the duties
of the office were practically nominal, except that a deputy lieutenant
might attest militia recruits and administer the oath of
allegiance to them. The reorganization in 1907 of the forces of the
British crown, and the formation of county associations to administer
the territorial army, placed increased duties on deputy
lieutenants, and it was publicly announced that the king&rsquo;s approval
of appointments to that position would only be given in the case
of gentlemen who had served for ten years in some force of the
crown, or had rendered eminent service in connexion with a county
association.</p>

<p>The lord lieutenant of Ireland is the head of the executive in that
country. He represents his sovereign and maintains the formalities
of government, the business of government being entrusted to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page600" id="page600"></a>600</span>
department of his chief secretary, who represents the Irish government
in the House of Commons, and may have a seat in the cabinet.
The chief secretary occupies an important position, and in every
cabinet either the lord lieutenant or he has a seat.</p>

<p>Lieutenant-governor is the title of the governor of an Indian
province, in direct subordination to the governor-general in council.
The lieutenant-governor comes midway in dignity between the
governors of Madras and Bombay, who are appointed from England,
and the chief commissioners of smaller provinces. In the Dominion
of Canada the governors of provinces also have the title of
lieutenant-governor. The representatives of the sovereign in the
Isle of Man and the Channel Islands are likewise styled lieutenant-governors.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIFE,<a name="ar126" id="ar126"></a></span> the popular name for the activity peculiar to protoplasm
(<i>q.v.</i>). This conception has been extended by analogy to
phenomena different in kind, such as the activities of masses
of water or of air, or of machinery, or by another analogy, to the
duration of a composite structure, and by imagination to real
or supposed phenomena such as the manifestations of incorporeal
entities. From the point of view of exact science life is associated
with matter, is displayed only by living bodies, by all living
bodies, and is what distinguishes living bodies from bodies that
are not alive. Herbert Spencer&rsquo;s formula that life is &ldquo;the
continuous adjustment of internal relations to external relations&rdquo;
was the result of a profound and subtle analysis, but omits the
fundamental consideration that we know life only as a quality
of and in association with living matter.</p>

<p>In developing our conception we must discard from consideration
the complexities that arise from the organization of the
higher living bodies, the differences between one living animal
and another, or between plant and animal. Such differentiations
and integrations of living bodies are the subject-matter of
discussions on evolution; some will see in the play of circumambient
media, natural or supernatural, on the simplest forms
of living matter, sufficient explanation of the development of
such matter into the highest forms of living organisms; others
will regard the potency of such living matter so to develop as a
mysterious and peculiar quality that must be added to the
conception of life. Choice amongst these alternatives need not
complicate investigation of the nature of life. The explanation
that serves for the evolution of living matter, the vehicle of life,
will serve for the evolution of life. What we have to deal with
here is life in its simplest form.</p>

<p>The definition of life must really be a description of the
essential characters of life, and we must set out with an investigation
of the characters of living substance with the special object
of detecting the differences between organisms and unorganized
matter, and the differences between dead and living organized
matter.</p>

<p>Living substance (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Protoplasm</a></span>), as it now exists in all
animals and plants, is particulate, consisting of elementary
organisms living independently, or grouped in communities,
the communities forming the bodies of the higher animals and
plants. These small particles or larger communities are subject
to accidents, internal or external, which destroy them, immediately
or slowly, and thus life ceases; or they may wear out,
or become clogged by the products of their own activity. There
is no reason to regard the mortality of protoplasm and the
consequent limited duration of life as more than the necessary
consequence of particulate character of living matter (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Longevity</a></span>).</p>

<p>Protoplasm, the living material, contains only a few elements,
all of which are extremely common and none of which is peculiar
to it. These elements, however, form compounds characteristic
of living substance and for the most part peculiar to it. Proteid,
which consists of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen and
sulphur, is present in all protoplasm, is the most complex of all
organic bodies, and, so far, is known only from organic bodies.
A multitude of minor and simpler organic compounds, of which
carbohydrates and fats are the best known, occur in different
protoplasm in varying forms and proportions, and are much less
isolated from the inorganic world. They may be stages in the
elaboration or disintegration of protoplasm, and although they
were at one time believed to occur only as products of living
matter, are gradually being conquered by the synthetic chemist.
Finally, protoplasm contains various inorganic substances,
such as salts and water, the latter giving it its varying degrees
of liquid consistency.</p>

<p>We attain, therefore, our first generalized description of life
as the property or peculiar quality of a substance composed of
none but the more common elements, but of these elements
grouped in various ways to form compounds ranging from
proteid, the most complex of known substances to the simplest
salts. The living substance, moreover, has its mixture of
elaborate and simple compounds associated in a fashion that is
peculiar. The older writers have spoken of protoplasm or the
cell as being in a sense &ldquo;manufactured articles&rdquo;; in the more
modern view such a conception is replaced by the statement
that protoplasm and the cell have behind them a long historical
architecture. Both ideas, or both modes of expressing what is
fundamentally the same idea, have this in common, that life
is not a sum of the qualities of the chemical elements contained
in protoplasm, but a function first of the peculiar
architecture of the mixture, and then of the high complexity
of the compounds contained in the mixture. The qualities of
water are no sum of the qualities of oxygen and hydrogen,
and still less can we expect to explain the qualities of life
without regard to the immense complexity of the living
substance.</p>

<p>We must now examine in more detail the differences which
exist or have been alleged to exist between living organisms
and inorganic bodies. There is no essential difference in structure.
Confusion has arisen in regard to this point from attempts
to compare organized bodies with crystals, the comparison
having been suggested by the view that as crystals present
the highest type of inorganic structure, it was reasonable
to compare them with organic matter. Differences between
crystals and organized bodies have no bearing on the problem
of life, for organic substance must be compared with a liquid
rather than with a crystal, and differs in structure no more from
inorganic liquids than these do amongst themselves, and less
than they differ from crystals. Living matter is a mixture of
substances chiefly dissolved in water; the comparison with the
crystals has led to a supposed distinction in the mode of growth,
crystals growing by the superficial apposition of new particles
and living substance by intussusception. But inorganic liquids
also grow in the latter mode, as when a soluble substance is
added to them.</p>

<p>The phenomena of movement do not supply any absolute
distinction. Although these are the most obvious characters
of life, they cannot be detected in quiescent seeds, which we
know to be alive, and they are displayed in a fashion very like
life by inorganic foams brought in contact with liquids of
different composition. Irritability, again, although a notable
quality of living substance, is not peculiar to it, for many inorganic
substances respond to external stimulation by definite
changes. Instability, again, which lies at the root of Spencer&rsquo;s
definition &ldquo;continuous adjustment of internal relations to
external relations&rdquo; is displayed by living matter in very varying
degrees from the apparent absolute quiescence of frozen seeds
to the activity of the central nervous system, whilst there is a
similar range amongst inorganic substances.</p>

<p>The phenomena of reproduction present no fundamental
distinction. Most living bodies, it is true, are capable of reproduction,
but there are many without this capacity, whilst, on the
other hand, it would be difficult to draw an effective distinction
between that reproduction of simple organisms which consists
of a sub-division of their substance with consequent resumption
of symmetry by the separate pieces, and the breaking up of a
drop of mercury into a number of droplets.</p>

<p>Consideration of the mode of origin reveals a more real if
not an absolute distinction. All living substance so far as is
known at present (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Biogenesis</a></span>) arises only from already
existing living substance. It is to be noticed, however, that green
plants have the power of building up living substance from
inorganic material, and there is a certain analogy between the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page601" id="page601"></a>601</span>
building up of new living material only in association with
pre-existing living material, and the greater readiness with which
certain inorganic reactions take place if there already be present
some trace of the result of the reaction.</p>

<p>The real distinction between living matter and inorganic
matter is chemical. Living substance always contains proteid,
and although we know that proteid contains only common
inorganic elements, we know neither how these are combined
to form proteid, nor any way in which proteid can be brought
into existence except in the presence of previously existing
proteid. The central position of the problem of life lies in the
chemistry of proteid, and until that has been fully explored,
we are unable to say that there is any problem of life behind
the problem of proteid.</p>

<p>Comparison of living and lifeless organic matter presents
the initial difficulty that we cannot draw an exact line between
a living and a dead organism. The higher &ldquo;warm-blooded&rdquo;
creatures appear to present the simplest case and in their life-history
there seems to be a point at which we can say &ldquo;that
which was alive is now dead.&rdquo; We judge from some major arrest
of activity, as when the heart ceases to beat. Long after this,
however, various tissues remain alive and active, and the event
to which we give the name of death is no more than a superficially
visible stage in a series of changes. In less highly
integrated organisms, such as &ldquo;cold-blooded&rdquo; vertebrates,
the point of death is less conspicuous, and when we carry our
observations further down the scale of animal life, there ceases
to be any salient phase in the slow transition from life to
death.</p>

<p>The distinction between life and death is made more difficult
by a consideration of cases of so-called &ldquo;arrested vitality.&rdquo;
If credit can be given to the stories of Indian fakirs, it appears
that human beings can pass voluntarily into a state of suspended
animation that may last for weeks. The state of involuntary
trance, sometimes mistaken for death, is a similar occurrence.
A. Leeuwenhoek, in 1719, made the remarkable discovery,
since abundantly confirmed, that many animalculae, notably
tardigrades and rotifers, may be completely desiccated and
remain in that condition for long periods without losing the power
of awaking to active life when moistened with water. W.
Preyer has more recently investigated the matter and has given
it the name &ldquo;anabiosis.&rdquo; Later observers have found similar
occurrences in the cases of small nematodes, rotifers and bacteria.
The capacity of plant seeds to remain dry and inactive for very
long periods is still better known. It has been supposed that
in the case of the plant seeds and still more in that of the animals,
the condition of anabiosis was merely one in which the metabolism
was too faint to be perceptible by ordinary methods of observation,
but the elaborate experiments of W. Kochs would seem
to show that a complete arrest of vital activity is compatible
with viability. The categories, &ldquo;alive&rdquo; and &ldquo;dead,&rdquo;
are not sufficiently distinct for us to add to our conception
of life by comparing them. A living organism usually
displays active metabolism of proteid, but the metabolism
may slow down, actually cease and yet reawaken; a dead
organism is one in which the metabolism has ceased and
does not reawaken.</p>

<p><i>Origin of Life.</i>&mdash;It is plain that we cannot discuss adequately
the origin of life or the possibility of the artificial construction
of living matter (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Abiogenesis</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Biogenesis</a></span>) until the
chemistry of protoplasm and specially of proteid is more advanced.
The investigations of O. Bütschli have shown how a model of
protoplasm can be manufactured. Very finely triturated
soluble particles are rubbed into a smooth paste with an oil
of the requisite consistency. A fragment of such a paste brought
into a liquid in which the solid particles are soluble, slowly
expands into a honeycomb like foam, the walls of the minute
vesicles being films of oil, and the contents being the soluble
particles dissolved in droplets of the circumambient liquid.
Such a model, properly constructed, that is to say, with the
vesicles of the foam microscopic in size, is a marvellous imitation
of the appearance of protoplasm, being distinguishable from it
only by a greater symmetry. The nicely balanced conditions
of solution produce a state of unstable equilibrium, with the
result that internal streaming movements and changes of shape
and changes of position in the model simulate closely the corresponding
manifestations in real protoplasm. The model has no
power of recuperation; in a comparatively short time equilibrium
is restored and the resemblance with protoplasm disappears.
But it suggests a method by which, when the chemistry of protoplasm
and proteid is better known, the proper substances which
compose protoplasm may be brought together to form a simple
kind of protoplasm.</p>

<p>It has been suggested from time to time that conditions very
unlike those now existing were necessary for the first appearance
of life, and must be repeated if living matter is to be constructed
artificially. No support for such a view can be derived from
observations of the existing conditions of life. The chemical
elements involved are abundant; the physical conditions of
temperature pressure and so forth at which living matter is
most active, and within the limits of which it is confined, are
familiar and almost constant in the world around us. On the
other hand, it may be that the initial conditions for the synthesis
of proteid are different from those under which proteid and living
matter display their activities. E. Pflüger has argued that the
analogies between living proteid and the compounds of cyanogen
are so numerous that they suggest cyanogen as the starting-point
of protoplasm. Cyanogen and its compounds, so far as we
know, arise only in a state of incandescent heat. Pflüger suggests
that such compounds arose when the surface of the earth was
incandescent, and that in the long process of cooling, compounds
of cyanogen and hydrocarbons passed into living protoplasm
by such processes of transformation and polymerization as are
familiar in the chemical groups in question, and by the acquisition
of water and oxygen. His theory is in consonance with the interpretation
of the structure of protoplasm as having behind it a
long historical architecture and leads to the obvious conclusion
that if protoplasm be constructed artificially it will be by a
series of stages and that the product will be simpler than any
of the existing animals or plants.</p>

<p>Until greater knowledge of protoplasm and particularly of
proteid has been acquired, there is no scientific room for the
suggestion that there is a mysterious factor differentiating
living matter from other matter and life from other activities.
We have to scale the walls, open the windows, and explore the
castle before crying out that it is so marvellous that it must
contain ghosts.</p>

<p>As may be supposed, theories of the origin of life apart from
doctrines of special creation or of a primitive and slow spontaneous
generation are mere fantastic speculations. The most striking of
these suggests an extra-terrestrial origin. H. E. Richter appears
to have been the first to propound the idea that life came to this
planet as cosmic dust or in meteorites thrown off from stars and
planets. Towards the end of the 19th century Lord Kelvin
(then Sir W. Thomson) and H. von Helmholtz independently
raised and discussed the possibility of such an origin of terrestrial
life, laying stress on the presence of hydrocarbons in meteoric
stones and on the indications of their presence revealed by the
spectra of the tails of comets. W. Preyer has criticized such
views, grouping them under the phrase &ldquo;theory of cosmozoa,&rdquo;
and has suggested that living matter preceded inorganic matter.
Preyer&rsquo;s view, however, enlarges the conception of life until it can
be applied to the phenomena of incandescent gases and has no
relation to ideas of life derived from observation of the living
matter we know.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIFE-BOAT,<a name="ar127" id="ar127"></a></span> and <span class="bold">LIFE-SAVING SERVICE.</span> The article on
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Drowning and Life-Saving</a></span> (<i>q.v.</i>) deals generally with the
means of saving life at sea, but under this heading it is convenient
to include the appliances connected specially with the life-boat
service. The ordinary open boat is unsuited for life-saving in
a stormy sea, and numerous contrivances, in regard to which
the lead came from England, have been made for securing the
best type of life-boat.</p>

<p>The first life-boat was conceived and designed by Lionel
Lukin, a London coach-builder, in 1785. Encouraged by the
prince of Wales (George IV.), Lukin fitted up a Norway yawl
as a life-boat, took out a patent for it, and wrote a pamphlet
descriptive of his &ldquo;Insubmergible Boat.&rdquo; Buoyancy he obtained
by means of a projecting gunwale of cork and air-chambers inside&mdash;one
of these being at the bow, another at the stern. Stability
he secured by a false iron keel. The self-righting and self-emptying
principles he seems not to have thought of; at all events he
did not compass them. Despite the patronage of the prince,
Lukin went to his grave a neglected and disappointed man.
But he was not altogether unsuccessful, for, at the request of the
Rev Dr Shairp, Lukin fitted up a coble as an &ldquo;unimmergible&rdquo;
life-boat, which was launched at Bamborough, saved several
lives the first year and afterwards saved many lives and much
property.</p>

<p>Public apathy in regard to shipwreck was temporally swept
away by the wreck of the &ldquo;Adventure&rdquo; of Newcastle in 1789.
This vessel was stranded only 300 yds. from the shore, and her
crew dropped, one by one, into the raging breakers in presence
of thousands of spectators, none of whom dared to put off in
an ordinary boat to the rescue. An excited meeting among the
people of South Shields followed; a committee was formed,
and premiums were offered for the best models of a life-boat.
This called forth many plans, of which those of William Wouldhave,
a painter, and Henry Greathead, a boatbuilder, of South
Shields, were selected. The committee awarded the prize to
the latter, and, adopting the good points of both models, gave
the order for the construction of their boat to Greathead. This
boat was rendered buoyant by nearly 7 cwts. of cork, and had
very raking stem and stern-posts, with great curvature of keel.
It did good service, and Greathead was well rewarded; nevertheless
no other life-boat was launched till 1798, when the duke of
Northumberland ordered Greathead to build him a life-boat which
he endowed. This boat also did good service, and its owner
ordered another in 1800 for Oporto. In the same year Mr Cathcart
Dempster ordered one for St Andrews, where, two years
later, it saved twelve lives. Thus the value of life-boats began
to be recognized, and before the end of 1803 Greathead had built
thirty-one boats&mdash;eighteen for England, five for Scotland and
eight for foreign lands. Nevertheless, public interest in life-boats
was not thoroughly aroused till 1823.</p>

<p>In that year Sir William Hillary, Bart., stood forth to champion
the life-boat cause. Sir William dwelt in the Isle of Man, and had
assisted with his own hand in the saving of three hundred and
five lives. In conjunction with two members of parliament&mdash;Mr
Thomas Wilson and Mr George Hibbert&mdash;Hillary founded
the &ldquo;Royal National Institution for the Preservation of Life
from Shipwreck.&rdquo; This, perhaps the grandest of England&rsquo;s
charitable societies, and now named the &ldquo;Royal National
Life-boat Institution,&rdquo; was founded on the 4th of March 1824.
The king patronized it; the archbishop of Canterbury presided
at its birth; the most eloquent men in the land&mdash;among them
Wilberforce&mdash;pleaded the cause; nevertheless, the institution
began its career with a sum of only £9826. In the first year
twelve new life-boats were built and placed at different stations,
besides which thirty-nine life-boats had been stationed on the
British shores by benevolent individuals and by independent
associations over which the institution exercised no control
though it often assisted them. In its early years the institution
placed the mortar apparatus of Captain Manby at many stations,
and provided for the wants of sailors and others saved from
shipwreck,&mdash;a duty subsequently discharged by the &ldquo;Shipwrecked
Fishermen and Mariners&rsquo; Royal Benevolent Society.&rdquo;
At the date of the institution&rsquo;s second report it had contributed
to the saving of three hundred and forty-two lives, either by
its own life-saving apparatus or by other means for which it
had granted rewards. With fluctuating success, both as regards
means and results, the institution continued its good work&mdash;saving
many lives, and occasionally losing a few brave men in
its tremendous battles with the sea. Since the adoption of the
self-righting boats, loss of life in the service has been comparatively
small and infrequent.</p>

<p>Towards the middle of the 19th century the life-boat cause
appeared to lose interest with the British public, though the life-saving
work was prosecuted with unremitting zeal, but the
increasing loss of life by shipwreck, and a few unusually severe
disasters to life-boats, brought about the reorganization of the
society in 1850. The Prince Consort became vice-patron of
the institution in conjunction with the king of the Belgians,
and Queen Victoria, who had been its patron since her accession,
became an annual contributor to its funds. In 1851 the duke of
Northumberland became president, and from that time forward
a tide of prosperity set in, unprecedented in the history of
benevolent institutions, both in regard to the great work accomplished
and the pecuniary aid received. In 1850 its committee
undertook the immediate superintendence of all the life-boat
work on the coasts, with the aid of local committees. Periodical
inspections, quarterly exercise of crews, fixed rates of payments
to coxswains and men, and quarterly reports, were instituted,
at the time when the self-righting self-emptying boat came into
being. This boat was the result of a hundred-guinea prize, offered
by the president, for the best model of a life-boat, with another
hundred to defray the cost of a boat built on the model
chosen. In reply to the offer no fewer than two hundred and
eighty models were sent in, not only from all parts of the
United Kingdom, but from France, Germany, Holland and the
United States of America. The prize was gained by Mr James
Beeching of Great Yarmouth, whose model, slightly modified
by Mr James Peake, one of the committee of inspection,
was still further improved as time and experience suggested
(see below).</p>

<p>The necessity of maintaining a thoroughly efficient life-boat
service is now generally recognized by the people not only
of Great Britain, but also of those other countries on the European
Continent and America which have a seaboard, and of the
British colonies, and numerous life-boat services have been
founded more or less on the lines of the Royal National Life-boat
Institution. The British Institution was again reorganized
in 1883; it has since greatly developed both in its life-saving
efficiency and financially, and has been spoken of in the highest
terms as regards its management by successive governments&mdash;a
Select Committee of the House of Commons in 1897 reporting
to the House that the thanks of the whole community were
due to the Institution for its energy and good management.
On the death of Queen Victoria in January 1901 she was succeeded
as patron of the Institution by Edward VII., who as prince
of Wales had been its president for several years. At the close
of 1908 the Institution&rsquo;s fleet consisted of 280 life-boats, and
the total number of lives for the saving of which the committee
of management had granted rewards since the establishment
of the Institution in 1824 was 47,983. At this time there were
only seventeen life-boats on the coast of the United Kingdom
which did not belong to the Institution. In 1882 the total
amount of money received by the Institution from all sources
was £57,797, whereas in 1901 the total amount received had
increased to £107,293. In 1908 the receipts were £115,303,
the expenditure £90,335.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In 1882 the Institution undertook, with the view of diminishing
the loss of life among the coast fishermen, to provide the masters
and owners of fishing-vessels with trustworthy aneroid barometers,
at about a third of the retail price, and in 1883 the privilege was
extended to the masters and owners of coasters under 100 tons
burden. At the end of 1901 as many as 4417 of these valuable
instruments had been supplied. In 1889 the committee of management
secured the passing of the Removal of Wrecks Act 1877
Amendment Act, which provides for the removal of wrecks in non-navigable
waters which might prove dangerous to life-boat crews
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page603" id="page603"></a>603</span>
and others. Under its provisions numerous highly dangerous wrecks
have been removed.</p>

<p>In 1893 the chairman of the Institution moved a resolution in
the House of Commons that, in order to decrease the serious loss of
life from shipwreck on the coast, the British Government should
provide either telephonic or telegraphic communication between all
the coast-guard stations and signal stations on the coast of the
United Kingdom; and that where there are no coast-guard stations
the post offices nearest to the life-boat stations should be electrically
connected, the object being to give the earliest possible information
to the life-boat authorities at all times, by day and night, when the
life-boats are required for service; and further, that a Royal Commission
should be appointed to consider the desirability of electrically
connecting the rock lighthouses, light-ships, &amp;c., with the shore.
The resolution was agreed to without a division, and its intention
has been practically carried out, the results obtained having proved
most valuable in the saving of life.</p>

<p>On the 1st of January 1898 a pension and gratuity scheme was
introduced by the committee of management, under which life-boat
coxswains, bowmen and signalmen of long and meritorious service,
retiring on account of old age, accident, ill-health or abolition of
office, receive special allowances as a reward for their good services.
While these payments act as an incentive to the men to discharge
their duties satisfactorily, they at the same time assist the committee
of management in their effort to obtain the best men for the work.
For many years the Institution has given compensation to any who
may have received injury while employed in the service, besides
granting liberal help to the widows and dependent relatives of any
in the service who lose their own lives when endeavouring to rescue
others.</p>

<p>A very marked advance in improvement in design and suitability
for service has been made in the life-boat since the reorganization
of the Institution in 1883, but principally since
1887, when, as the result of an accident in December 1886
to two self-righting life-boats in Lancashire, twenty-seven out
of twenty-nine of the men who manned them were drowned.
At this time a permanent technical sub-committee was appointed
by the Institution, whose object was, with the assistance
of an eminent consulting naval architect&mdash;a new post created&mdash;and
the Institution&rsquo;s official experts, to give its careful attention
to the designing of improvements in the life-boat and its equipment,
and to the scientific consideration of any inventions
or proposals submitted by the public, with a view to adopting
them if of practical utility. Whereas in 1881 the self-righting
life-boat of that time was looked upon as the Institution&rsquo;s
special life-boat, and there were very few life-boats in the
Institution&rsquo;s fleet not of that type, at the close of 1901 the
life-boats of the Institution included 60 non-self-righting boats
of various types, known by the following designations: Steam
life-boats 4, Cromer 3, Lamb and White 1, Liverpool 14, Norfolk
and Suffolk 19, tubular 1, Watson 18. In 1901 a steam-tug
was placed at Padstow for use solely in conjunction with the
life-boats on the north coast of Cornwall. The self-righting
life-boat of 1901 was a very different boat from that of 1881.
The Institution&rsquo;s present policy is to allow the men who man
the life-boats, after having seen and tried by deputation the
various types, to select that in which they have the most confidence.</p>

<p>The present life-boat of the self-righting type (fig. 2) differs
materially from its predecessor, the stability being increased
and the righting power greatly improved. The test of efficiency
in this last quality was formerly considered sufficient if the
boat would quickly right herself in smooth water without her
crew and gear, but every self-righting life-boat now built by
the Institution will right with her full crew and gear on board,
with her sails set and the anchor down. Most of the larger
self-righting boats are furnished with &ldquo;centre-boards&rdquo; or
&ldquo;drop-keels&rdquo; of varying size and weight, which can be used
at pleasure, and materially add to their weather qualities.
The drop-keel was for the first time placed in a life-boat in
1885.</p>

<p class="pt2">Steam was first introduced into a life-boat in 1890, when
the Institution, after very full inquiry and consideration,
stationed on the coast a steel life-boat, 50 ft. long and 12 ft.
beam, and a depth of 3 ft. 6 in., propelled by a turbine wheel
driven by engines developing 170 horse-power. It had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page604" id="page604"></a>604</span>
previously held by all competent judges that a mechanically-propelled
life-boat, suitable for service in heavy weather, was
a problem surrounded by so many and great difficulties that
even the most sanguine experts dared not hope for an early
solution of it. This type of boat (fig. 3) has proved very useful.
It is, however, fully recognized that boats of this description
can necessarily be used at only a very limited number of stations,
and where there is a harbour which never dries out. The highest
speed attained by the first hydraulic steam life-boat was rather
more than 9 knots, and that secured in the latest 9½ knots.
In 1909 the fleet of the Institution included 4 steam life-boats
and 8 motor life-boats. The experiments with motor life-boats
in previous years had proved successful.</p>

<p>The other types of pulling and sailing life-boats are all non-self-righting,
and are specially suitable for the requirements
of the different parts of the coast on which they are placed.
Their various qualities will be understood by a glance at the
illustrations (figs. 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8).</p>

<p class="pt2">The Institution continues to build life-boats of different
sizes according to the requirements of the various points of
the coast at which they are placed, but of late years the tendency
has been generally to increase the dimensions of the boats.
This change of policy is mainly due to the fact that the small
coasters and fishing-boats have in great measure disappeared,
their places being taken by steamers and steam trawlers. The
cost of the building and equipping of pulling and sailing life-boats
has materially increased, more especially since 1898,
the increase being mainly due to improvements and the seriously
augmented charges for materials and labour. In 1881 the
average cost of a fully-equipped life-boat and carriage was
£650, whereas at the end of 1901 it amounted to £1000, the
average annual cost of maintaining a station having risen
to about £125.</p>

<p>The <i>transporting-carriage</i> continues to be a most important
part of the equipment of life-boats, generally of the self-righting
type, and is indispensable where it is necessary to launch the
boats at any point not in the immediate vicinity of the boat-house.
It is not, however, usual to supply carriages to boats
of larger dimensions than 37 ft. in length by 9 ft. beam, those
in excess as regards length and beam being either launched
by means of special slipways or kept afloat. The transporting-carriage
of to-day has been rendered particularly useful at
places where the beach is soft, sandy or shingly, by the introduction
in 1888 of Tipping&rsquo;s sand-plates. They are composed
of an endless plateway or jointed wheel tyre fitted to the main
wheels of the carriage, thereby enabling the boat to be transferred
with rapidity and with greatly decreased labour over
beach and soft sand. Further efficiency in launching has also
been attained at many stations by the introduction in 1890
of pushing-poles, attached to the transporting-carriages, and
of horse launching-poles, first used in 1892. Fig. 9 gives a
view of the modern transporting-carriage fitted with Tipping&rsquo;s
sand- or wheel-plates.</p>

<p>The <i>life-belt</i> has since 1898 been considerably improved,
being now less cumbersome than formerly, and more comfortable.
The feature of the principal improvement is the reduction in
length of the corks under the arms of the wearer and the rounding-off
of the upper portions, the result being that considerably
more freedom is provided for the arms. The maximum extra
buoyancy has thereby been reduced from 25 &#8468; to 22 &#8468;, which
is more than sufficient to support a man heavily clothed with
his head and shoulders above the water, or to enable him to
support another person besides himself. Numerous life-belts
of very varied descriptions, and made of all sorts of materials,
have been patented, but it is generally agreed that for life-boat
work the cork life-belt of the Institution has not yet been
equalled.</p>

nothing indispensable has as yet been brought out. Those
interested in life-saving appliances were hopeful that the Paris
Exhibition of 1900 would have produced some life-saving
invention which might prove a benefit to the civilized world,
but so lacking in real merit were the life-saving exhibits that

<p>The <i>rocket apparatus</i>, which in the United Kingdom is under
the management of the coast-guard, renders excellent service
in life-saving. This, next to the life-boat, is the most important
and successful means by which shipwrecked persons are rescued
on the British shores. Many vessels are cast every year on the
rocky parts of the coasts, under cliffs, where no life-boat could
be of service. In such places the rocket alone is available.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The rocket apparatus consists of five principal parts, viz. the
rocket, the rocket-line, the whip, the hawser and the sling life-buoy.
The mode of working it is as follows. A rocket, having a light line
attached to it, is fired over the wreck. By means of this line the
wrecked crew haul out the whip, which is a double or endless line,
rove through a block with a tail attached to it. The tail-block,
having been detached from the rocket-line, is fastened to a mast, or
other portion of the wreck, high above the water. By means of the
whip the rescuers haul off the hawser, to which is hung the travelling
or sling life-buoy. When one end of the hawser has been made
fast to the mast, about 18 in. <i>above</i> the whip, and its other end
to tackle fixed to an anchor on shore, the life-buoy is run out by the
rescuers, and the shipwrecked persons, getting into it one at a time,
are hauled ashore. Sometimes, in cases of urgency, the life-buoy is
worked by means of the whip alone, without the hawser. Captain
G. W. Manby, F.R.S., in 1807 invented, or at least introduced, the
mortar apparatus, on which the system of the rocket apparatus,
which superseded it in England, is founded. Previously, however,
in 1791, the idea of throwing a rope from a wreck to the shore by
means of a shell from a mortar had occurred to Serjeant Bell of the
Royal Artillery, and about the same time, to a Frenchman named
La Fère, both of whom made successful experiments with their
apparatus. In the same year (1807) a rocket was proposed by Mr
Trengrouse of Helston in Cornwall, also a hand and lead line as
means of communicating with vessels in distress. The <i>heaving-cane</i>
was a fruit of the latter suggestion. In 1814 forty-five mortar
stations were established, and Manby received £2000, in addition
to previous grants, in acknowledgment of the good service rendered
by his invention. Mr John Dennett of Newport, Isle of Wight,
introduced the rocket, which was afterwards extensively used. In
1826 four places in the Isle of Wight were supplied with Dennett&rsquo;s
rockets, but it was not till after government had taken the apparatus
under its own control, in 1855, that the rocket invented by Colonel
Boxer was adopted. Its peculiar characteristic lies in the combination
of two rockets in one case, one being a continuation of the
other, so that, after the first compartment has carried the machine
to its full elevation, the second gives it an additional impetus
whereby a great increase of range is obtained.</p>

<p><span class="sc">United States</span>.&mdash;In the extent of coast line covered, magnitude
of operations and the extraordinary success which has
crowned its efforts, the life-saving service of the United States
is not surpassed by any other institution of its kind in the
world. Notwithstanding the exposed and dangerous nature
of the coasts flanking and stretching between the approaches to
the principal seaports, and the immense amount of shipping
concentrating upon them, the loss of life among a total of 121,459
persons imperilled by marine casualty within the scope of the
operations of the service from its organization in 1871 to the 30th
of June 1907, was less than 1%, and even this small proportion
is made up largely of persons washed overboard immediately
upon the striking of vessels and before any assistance could
reach them, or lost in attempts to land in their own boats, and
people thrown into the sea by the capsizing of small craft. In
the scheme of the service, next in importance to the saving of
life is the saving of property from marine disaster, for which no
salvage or reward is allowed. During the period named vessels
and cargoes to the value of nearly two hundred million dollars
were saved, while only about a quarter as much was lost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page606" id="page606"></a>606</span></p>

<p>The first government life-saving stations were plain boat-houses
erected on the coast of New Jersey in 1848, each equipped with
a fisherman&rsquo;s surf-boat and a mortar and life-car with accessories.
Prior to this time, as early as 1789, a benevolent organization
known as the Massachusetts Humane Society had erected rude
huts along the coast of that state, followed by a station at
Cohasset in 1807 equipped with a boat for use by volunteer crews.
Others were subsequently added. Between 1849 and 1870 this
society secured appropriations from Congress aggregating
$40,000. It still maintains sixty-nine stations on the Massachusetts
coast. The government service was extended in 1849
to the coast of Long Island, and in 1850 one station was placed
on the Rhode Island coast. In 1854 the appointment of keepers
for the New Jersey and Long Island stations, and a superintendent
for each of these coasts, was authorized by law. Volunteer
crews were depended upon until 1870, when Congress authorized
crews at each alternate station for the three winter months.</p>

<p>The present system was inaugurated in 1871 by Sumner I.
Kimball, who in that year was appointed chief of the Revenue
Cutter Service, which had charge of the few existing stations.
He recommended an appropriation of $200,000 and authority
for the employment of crews for all stations for such periods
as were deemed necessary, which were granted. The existing
stations were thoroughly overhauled and put in condition for
the housing of crews; necessary boats and equipment were
furnished; incapable keepers, who had been appointed largely
for political reasons, were supplanted by experienced men;
additional stations were established; all were manned by
capable surfmen; the merit system for appointments and
promotions was inaugurated; a beach patrol system was
introduced, together with a system of signals; and regulations
for the government of the service were promulgated. The
result of the transformation was immediate and striking. At
the end of the year it was found that not a life had been lost
within the domain of the service; and at the end of the second
year the record was almost identical, but one life having been
lost, although the service had been extended to embrace the
dangerous coast of Cape Cod. Legislation was subsequently
secured, totally eliminating politics in the choice of officers and
men, and making other provisions necessary for the completion
of the system. The service continued to grow in extent and
importance until, in 1878, it was separated from the Revenue
Cutter Service and organized into a separate bureau of the
Treasury, its administration being placed in the hands of a
general superintendent appointed by the president and confirmed
by the senate, his term of office being limited only by the
will of the president. Mr Kimball was appointed to the position,
which he still held in 1909.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The service embraces thirteen districts, with 280 stations located
at selected points upon the sea and lake coasts. Nine districts on
the Atlantic and Gulf coasts contain 201 stations, including nine
houses of refuge on the Florida coast, each in charge of a keeper
only, without crews; three districts on the Great Lakes contain 61
stations, including one at the falls of the Ohio river, Louisville,
Kentucky; and one district on the Pacific coast contains 18 stations,
including one at Nome, Alaska.</p>

<p>The general administration of the service is conducted by a
general superintendent; an inspector of life-saving stations and
two superintendents of construction of life-saving stations detailed
from the Revenue Cutter Service; a district superintendent for
each district; and assistant inspectors of stations, also detailed
from the Revenue Cutter Service &ldquo;to perform such duties in connexion
with the conduct of the service as the general superintendent
may require.&rdquo; There is also an advisory board on life-saving
appliances consisting of experts, to consider devices and inventions
submitted by the general superintendent.</p>

<p>Station crews are composed of a keeper and from six to eight
surfmen, with an additional man during the winter months at
most of the stations on the Atlantic coast. The surfmen are reenlisted
from year to year during good behaviour, subject to a
thorough physical examination. The keepers are also subject to
annual physical examinations after attaining the age of fifty-five.
Stations on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts are manned from August
1st to May 31st. On the lakes the active season covers the period
of navigation, from about April 1st to early in December. The
falls station at Louisville, and all stations on the Pacific coast, are
in commission continuously. One station, located in Dorchester
Bay, an expanse of water within Boston harbour, where numerous
yachts rendezvous and many accidents occur, which, with the one
at Louisville are, believed to be the only floating life-saving stations
in the world, is manned from May 1st to November 15th. Its
equipment includes a steam tug and two gasoline launches, the
latter being harboured in a slip cut into the after-part of the station
and extending from the stern to nearly amidships. The Louisville
stations guard the falls of the Ohio river, where life is much endangered
from accidents to vessels passing over the falls and small
craft which are liable to be drawn into the chutes while attempting
to cross the river. Its equipment includes two river skiffs which
can be instantly launched directly from the ways at one end of the
station. These skiffs are small boats modelled much like surf-boats,
designed to be rowed by one or two men. Other equipments are
provided for the salvage of property. The stations, located as
near as practicable to a launching place, contain as a rule convenient
quarters for the residence of the keeper and crew and a boat and
apparatus room. In some instances the dwelling- and boat-house
are built separately. Each station has a look-out tower for the day
watch.</p>

<p>The principal apparatus consists of surf- and life-boats, Lyle
gun and breeches-buoy apparatus and life-car. The Hunt gun and
Cunningham line-carrying rocket are available at selected stations
on account of their greater range, but their use is rarely necessary.
The crews are drilled daily in some portion of rescue work, as practice
in man&oelig;uvring, upsetting and righting boats, with the breeches-buoy,
in the resuscitation of the apparently drowned and in signalling.
The district officers upon their quarterly visits examine
the crews orally and by drill, recording the proficiency of each
member, including the keeper, which record accompanies their
report to the general superintendent. For watch and patrol the
day of twenty-four hours is divided into periods of four or five hours
each. Day watches are stood by one man in the look-out tower or
at some other point of vantage, while two men are assigned to
each night watch between sunset and sunrise. One of the men
remains on watch at the station, dividing his time between the
beach look-out and visits to the telephone at specified intervals to
receive messages, the service telephone system being extended from
station to station nearly throughout the service, with watch telephones
at half-way points. The other man patrols the beach to
the end of his beat and returns, when he takes the look-out and his
watchmate patrols in the opposite direction. A like patrol and
watch is maintained in thick or stormy weather in the daytime.
Between adjacent stations a record of the patrol is made by the
exchange of brass checks; elsewhere the patrolman carries a watchman&rsquo;s
clock, on the dial of which he records the time of his arrival
at the keypost which marks the end of his beat. On discovering a
vessel standing into danger the patrolman burns a Coston signal,
which emits a brilliant red flare, to warn the vessel of her danger.
The number of vessels thus warned averages about two hundred in
each year, whereby great losses are averted, the extent of which
can never be known. When a stranded vessel is discovered, the
patrolman&rsquo;s Coston signal apprises the crew that they are seen
and assistance is at hand. He then notifies his station, by telephone
if possible. When such notice is received at the station, the keeper
determines the means with which to attempt a rescue, whether by
boat or beach-apparatus. If the beach-apparatus is chosen, the
apparatus cart is hauled to a point directly opposite the wreck by
horses, kept at most of the stations during the inclement months,
or by the members of the crew. The gear is unloaded, and while
being set up&mdash;the members of the crew performing their several
allotted parts simultaneously&mdash;the keeper fires a line over the
wreck with the Lyle gun, a small bronze cannon weighing, with its
18 &#8468; elongated iron projectile to which the line is attached, slightly
more than 200 &#8468;, and having an extreme range of about 700 yds.,
though seldom available at wrecks for more than 400 yds. This
gun was the invention of Lieutenant (afterwards Colonel) David A.
Lyle, U.S. Army. Shot lines are of three sizes, <span class="spp">4</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">32</span>, <span class="spp">7</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">32</span> and <span class="spp">9</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">32</span> of an
inch diameter, designated respectively Nos. 4, 7 and 9. The two
larger are ordinarily used, the No. 4 for extreme range. A line
having been fired within reach of the persons on the wreck, an endless
rope rove through a tail-block is sent out by it with instructions,
printed in English and French on a tally-board, to make the tail
fast to a mast or other elevated portion of the wreck. This done, a
3-in. hawser is bent on to the whip and hauled off to the wreck,
to be made fast a little above the tail-block, after which the shore
end is hauled taut over a crotch by means of tackle attached to a
sand anchor. From this hawser the breeches-buoy or life-car is
suspended and drawn between the ship and shore of the endless
whip-line. The life-car can also be drawn like a boat between ship
and shore without the use of a hawser. The breeches-buoy is a
cork life-buoy to which is attached a pair of short canvas breeches,
the whole suspended from a traveller block by suitable lanyards.
It usually carries one person at a time, although two have frequently
been brought ashore together. The life-car, first introduced in
1848, is a boat of corrugated iron with a convex iron cover, having
a hatch in the top for the admission of passengers, which can be
fastened either from within or without, and a few perforations to
admit air, with raised edges to exclude water. At wreck operations
during the night the shore is illuminated by powerful acetylene
(calcium carbide) lights. If any of the rescued persons are frozen,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page607" id="page607"></a>607</span>
as often happens, or are injured or sick, first aid and simple
remedies are furnished them. Dry clothing, supplied by the Women&rsquo;s
National Relief Association, is also furnished to survivors, which the
destitute are allowed to keep.</p>

<p>Several types of light open surf-boats are used, adapted to the
special requirements of the different localities and occasions. They
are built of cedar, from 23 to 27 ft. long, and are provided with
end air chambers and longitudinal air cases on each side under the
thwarts.</p>

<p>Self-righting and self-bailing life-boats, patterned after those
used in England and other countries, have heretofore been used at
most of the Lake stations and at points on the ocean coast where
they can be readily launched from ways. Most of these boats,
however, have now been transformed into power boats without
the sacrifice of any of their essential qualities. The installation of
power is effected by introducing a 25 H.P. four-cycle gasoline motor,
weighing with its fittings, tanks, &amp;c., about 800 &#8468;. The engine is
installed in the after air chamber, with the starting crank, reversing
clutches, &amp;c., recessed into the bulkhead to protect them from
accidents. These boats attain a speed of from 7 to 9 m. an hour,
and have proved extremely efficient. A new power life-boat (fig. 10)
on somewhat improved lines, 36 ft. in length, and equipped with
a 35-40 H.P. gasoline engine, promises to prove still more efficient.
A number of surf-boats have also been equipped with gasoline
engines of from 5 to 7 H.P., for light and quick work, with very
satisfactory results.</p>

<p>A distinctively American life-boat extensively used is the Beebe-McLellan
self-bailing boat (fig. 11), which for all round life-saving
work is held in the highest esteem. It possesses all the qualities of
the self-righting and self-bailing life-boats in use in all life-saving
institutions, except that of self-righting; and the sacrifice of this
quality is largely counteracted by the ease with which it can be
righted by its crew when capsized. For accomplishing this the
crews are thoroughly drilled. In drill a trained crew can upset and
right the boat and resume their places at the oars in twenty seconds.
The boat is built of cedar, weighs about 1200 &#8468;, and can be used
at all stations and launched by the crew directly off the beach
from the boat-wagon especially made for it. The self-bailing
quality is secured by a water-tight deck at a level a little above the
load water line with relieving tubes fitted with valves through
which any water shipped runs back into the sea by gravity. Air
cases along the sides under the thwarts, inclining towards the
middle of the boat, minimize the quantity of water taken in, and the
water-ballast tank in the bottom increases the stability by the
weight of the water which can be admitted by opening the valve.
When transported along the land it is empty. The Beebe-McLellan
boat is 25 ft. long, 7 ft. beam, and will carry 12 to 15 persons in
addition to its crew. Some of these boats, intended for use in
localities where the temperature of the water will not permit of
frequent upsetting and righting drills, are built with end air cases
which render them self-righting.</p>

<p>In addition to the principal appliances described, a number of
minor importance are included in the equipment of every life-saving
station, such as launching carriages for life-boats, roller boat-skids,
heaving sticks and all necessary tools. Members of all life-saving
crews are required on all occasions of boat practice or duty at
wrecks to wear life-belts of the prescribed pattern.</p>

<p><i>Life-boat Service in other Countries.</i>&mdash;Good work is done by the
life-boat service in other countries, most of these institutions
having been formed on the lines of the Royal National Life-boat
Institution of Great Britain. The services are operating in the
following countries:&mdash;</p>

affairs are managed by a president and a vice-president, supported
by a very influential council. The head office is at Tôkyô; there are
numerous branches with local committees. The Imperial government
contributes an annual subsidy of 20,000 <i>yen</i> (£2000). The
members of the Institution consist of three classes&mdash;honorary,
ordinary and sub-ordinary, the amount contributed by the member
determining the class in which he is placed. The chairman and
council are not, as in Great Britain, appointed by the subscribers,
but by the president, who must always be a member of the imperial
family. The Institution bestows three medals: (<i>a</i>) the medal of
merit, to be awarded to persons rendering distinguished service to
the Institution; (<i>b</i>) the medal of membership, to be held by honorary
and ordinary members or subscribers; and (<i>c</i>) the medal of praise,
which is bestowed on those distinguishing themselves by special
service in the work of rescue.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIGHT.<a name="ar131" id="ar131"></a></span> <i>Introduction.</i>&mdash;§ 1. &ldquo;Light&rdquo; may be defined subjectively
as the sense-impression formed by the eye. This is
the most familiar connotation of the term, and suffices for the
discussion of optical subjects which do not require an objective
definition, and, in particular, for the treatment of physiological
optics and vision. The objective definition, or the &ldquo;nature of
light,&rdquo; is the <i>ultima Thule</i> of optical research. &ldquo;Emission
theories,&rdquo; based on the supposition that light was a stream of
corpuscles, were at first accepted. These gave place during the
opening decades of the 19th century to the &ldquo;undulatory or wave
theory,&rdquo; which may be regarded as culminating in the &ldquo;elastic
solid theory&rdquo;&mdash;so named from the lines along which the mathematical
investigation proceeded&mdash;and according to which light
is a transverse vibratory motion propagated longitudinally
though the aether. The mathematical researches of James
Clerk Maxwell have led to the rejection of this theory, and it is
now held that light is identical with electromagnetic disturbances,
such as are generated by oscillating electric currents or moving
magnets. Beyond this point we cannot go at present. To quote
Arthur Schuster (<i>Theory of Optics</i>, 1904), &ldquo;So long as the character
of the displacements which constitute the waves remains
undefined we cannot pretend to have established a theory of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page609" id="page609"></a>609</span>
light.&rdquo; It will thus be seen that optical and electrical phenomena
are co-ordinated as a phase of the physics of the &ldquo;aether,&rdquo; and
that the investigation of these sciences culminates in the derivation
of the properties of this conceptual medium, the existence
of which was called into being as an instrument of research.<a name="fa1n" id="fa1n" href="#ft1n"><span class="sp">1</span></a>
The methods of the elastic-solid theory can still be used with
advantage in treating many optical phenomena, more especially
so long as we remain ignorant of fundamental matters concerning
the origin of electric and magnetic strains and stresses; in
addition, the treatment is more intelligible, the researches on
the electromagnetic theory leading in many cases to the derivation
of differential equations which express quantitative relations
between diverse phenomena, although no precise meaning can
be attached to the symbols employed. The school following
Clerk Maxwell and Heinrich Hertz has certainly laid the foundations
of a complete theory of light and electricity, but the methods
must be adopted with caution, lest one be constrained to say
with Ludwig Boltzmann as in the introduction to his <i>Vorlesungen
über Maxwell&rsquo;s Theorie der Elektricität und des Lichtes</i>:&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg f90" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>&ldquo;So soll ich denn mit saurem Schweiss</p>
<p class="i05">Euch lehren, was ich selbst nicht weiss.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="i10"><span class="sc">Goethe</span>, <i>Faust</i>.</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p>The essential distinctions between optical and electromagnetic
phenomena may be traced to differences in the lengths of light-waves
and of electromagnetic waves. The aether can probably
transmit waves of any wave-length, the velocity of longitudinal
propagation being about 3.10<span class="sp">10</span> cms. per second. The shortest
waves, discovered by Schumann and accurately measured by
Lyman, have a wave-length of 0.0001 mm.; the ultra-violet,
recognized by their action on the photographic plate or by their
promoting fluorescence, have a wave-length of 0.0002 mm.;
the eye recognizes vibrations of a wave-length ranging from
about 0.0004 mm. (violet) to about 0.0007 (red); the infra-red
rays, recognized by their heating power or by their action on
phosphorescent bodies, have a wave-length of 0.001 mm.; and
the longest waves present in the radiations of a luminous source
are the residual rays (&ldquo;<i>Rest-strahlen</i>&rdquo;) obtained by repeated
reflections from quartz (.0085 mm.), from fluorite (0.056 mm.),
and from sylvite (0.06 mm.). The research-field of optics includes
the investigation of the rays which we have just enumerated.
A delimitation may then be made, inasmuch as luminous sources
yield no other radiations, and also since the next series of waves,
the electromagnetic waves, have a minimum wave-length of 6 mm.</p>

<p>§ 2. The commonest subjective phenomena of light are colour
and visibility, <i>i.e.</i> why are some bodies visible and others not,
or, in other words, what is the physical significance of the words
&ldquo;transparency,&rdquo; &ldquo;colour&rdquo; and &ldquo;visibility.&rdquo; What is ordinarily
understood by a <i>transparent</i> substance is one which transmits
all the rays of white light without appreciable absorption&mdash;that
some absorption does occur is perceived when the substance
is viewed through a sufficient thickness. <i>Colour</i> is due to the
absorption of certain rays of the spectrum, the unabsorbed
rays being transmitted to the eye, where they occasion the
sensation of colour (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Colour</a></span>; <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Absorption of Light</a></span>).
Transparent bodies are seen partly by reflected and partly by
transmitted light, and opaque bodies by absorption. Refraction
also influences visibility. Objects immersed in a liquid of
the same refractive index and dispersion would be invisible;
for example, a glass rod can hardly be seen when immersed in
Canada balsam; other instances occur in the petrological
examination of rock-sections under the microscope. In a complex
rock-section the boldness with which the constituents stand
out are measures of the difference between their refractive indices
and the refractive index of the mounting medium, and the
more nearly the indices coincide the less defined become the
boundaries, while the interior of the mineral may be most advantageously
explored. Lord Rayleigh has shown that transparent
objects can only be seen when non-uniformly illuminated,
the differences in the refractive indices of the substance and the
surrounding medium becoming inoperative when the illumination
is uniform on all sides. R. W. Wood has performed experiments
which confirm this view.</p>

<p>The analysis of white light into the spectrum colours, and the
reformation of the original light by transmitting the spectrum
through a reversed prism, proved, to the satisfaction of Newton
and subsequent physicists until late in the 19th century, that the
various coloured rays were present in white light, and that the
action of the prism was merely to sort out the rays. This view,
which suffices for the explanation of most phenomena, has now
been given up, and the modern view is that the prism or grating
really does <i>manufacture</i> the colours, as was held previously to
Newton. It appears that white light is a sequence of irregular
wave trains which are analysed into series of more regular
trains by the prism or grating in a manner comparable with
the analytical resolution presented by Fourier&rsquo;s theorem. The
modern view points to the <i>mathematical</i> existence of waves of
all wave-lengths in white light, the Newtonian view to the
<i>physical</i> existence. Strictly, the term &ldquo;monochromatic&rdquo;
light is only applicable to light of a single wave-length (which
can have no actual existence), but it is commonly used to denote
light which cannot be analysed by the instruments at our disposal;
for example, with low-power instruments the light emitted by
sodium vapour would be regarded as homogeneous or monochromatic,
but higher power instruments resolve this light into
two components of different wave-lengths, each of which is of
a higher degree of homogeneity, and it is not impossible that
these rays may be capable of further analysis.</p>

<p>§ 3. <i>Divisions of the Subject.</i>&mdash;In the early history of the
science of light or optics a twofold division was adopted: <i>Catoptrics</i>
(from Gr. <span class="grk" title="katoptron">&#954;&#940;&#964;&#959;&#960;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#957;</span>, a mirror), embracing the phenomena
of reflection, <i>i.e.</i> the formation of images by mirrors; and
<i>Dioptrics</i> (Gr. <span class="grk" title="dia">&#948;&#953;&#940;</span>, through), embracing the phenomena of
refraction, <i>i.e.</i> the bending of a ray of light when passing obliquely
through the surface dividing two media.<a name="fa2n" id="fa2n" href="#ft2n"><span class="sp">2</span></a> A third
element, <i>Chromatics</i> (Gr. <span class="grk" title="chrôma">&#967;&#961;&#8182;&#956;&#945;</span>, colour), was subsequently
introduced to include phenomena involving colour transformations,
such as the iridescence of mother-of-pearl, feathers, soap-bubbles,
oil floating on water, &amp;c. This classification has
been discarded (although the terms, particularly &ldquo;dioptric&rdquo;
and &ldquo;chromatic,&rdquo; have survived as adjectives) in favour of
a twofold division: geometrical optics and physical optics.
<i>Geometrical optics</i> is a mathematical development (mainly
effected by geometrical methods) of three laws assumed to
be rigorously true: (1) the law of rectilinear propagation, viz.
that light travels in straight lines or <i>rays</i> in any homogeneous
medium; (2) the law of reflection, viz. that the incident and
reflected rays at any point of a surface are equally inclined
to, and coplanar with, the normal to the surface at the point
of incidence; and (3) the law of refraction, viz. that the incident
and refracted rays at a surface dividing two media make angles
with the normal to the surface at the point of incidence whose
sines are in a ratio (termed the &ldquo;refractive index&rdquo;) which is
constant for every particular pair of media, and that the incident
and refracted rays are coplanar with the normal. <i>Physical
optics</i>, on the other hand, has for its ultimate object the elucidation
of the question: what is light? It investigates the
nature of the rays themselves, and, in addition to determining
the validity of the axioms of geometrical optics, embraces
phenomena for the explanation of which an expansion of these
assumptions is necessary.</p>

<p>Of the subordinate phases of the science, &ldquo;physiological
optics&rdquo; is concerned with the phenomena of vision, with the
eye as an optical instrument, with colour-perception, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page610" id="page610"></a>610</span>
with such allied subjects as the appearance of the eyes of a cat
and the luminosity of the glow-worm and firefly; &ldquo;meteorological
optics&rdquo; includes phenomena occasioned by the atmosphere,
such as the rainbow, halo, corona, mirage, twinkling of
stars and colour of the sky, and also the effects of atmospheric
dust in promoting such brilliant sunsets as were seen after
the eruption of Krakatoa; &ldquo;magneto-optics&rdquo; investigates
the effects of electricity and magnetism on optical properties;
&ldquo;photo-chemistry,&rdquo; with its more practical development
photography, is concerned with the influence of light in effecting
chemical action; and the term &ldquo;applied optics&rdquo; may
be used to denote, on the one hand, the experimental investigation
of material for forming optical systems, <i>e.g.</i> the study of
glasses with a view to the formation of a glass of specified optical
properties (with which may be included such matters as the
transparency of rock-salt for the infra-red and of quartz for
the ultra-violet rays), and, on the other hand, the application
of geometrical and physical investigations to the construction
of optical instruments.</p>

<p>§ 4. <i>Arrangement of the Subject.</i>&mdash;The following three divisions
of this article deal with: (I.) the history of the science of light;
(II.) the nature of light; (III.) the velocity of light; but a
summary (which does not aim at scientific precision) may
here be given to indicate to the reader the inter-relation of
the various optical phenomena, those phenomena which are
treated in separate articles being shown in larger type.</p>

<p>The simplest subjective phenomena of light are <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Colour</a></span>
and intensity, the measurement of the latter being named
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Photometry</a></span>. When light falls on a medium, it may be returned
by <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Reflection</a></span> or it may suffer <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Absorption</a></span>; or it may
be transmitted and undergo <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Refraction</a></span>, and, if the light
be composite, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Dispersion</a></span>; or, as in the case of oil films on
water, brilliant colours are seen, an effect which is due to <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Interference</a></span>.
Again, if the rays be transmitted in two directions,
as with certain crystals, &ldquo;double refraction&rdquo; (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Refraction,
Double</a></span>) takes place, and the emergent rays have undergone
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Polarization</a></span>. A <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Shadow</a></span> is cast by light falling on an opaque
object, the complete theory of which involves the phenomenon
of <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Diffraction</a></span>. Some substances have the property of transforming
luminous radiations, presenting the phenomena of
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Calorescence</a></span>, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Fluorescence</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Phosphorescence</a></span>. An
optical system is composed of any number of <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Mirrors</a></span> or <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Lenses</a></span>,
or of both. If light falling on a system be not brought to a
focus, <i>i.e.</i> if all the emergent rays be not concurrent, we are
presented with a <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Caustic</a></span> and an <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Aberration</a></span>. An optical
instrument is simply the setting up of an optical system, the
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Telescope</a></span>, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Microscope</a></span>, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Objective</a></span>, optical <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Lantern</a></span>,
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Camera Lucida</a></span>, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Camera Obscura</a></span> and the <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Kaleidoscope</a></span>
are examples; instruments serviceable for simultaneous vision
with both eyes are termed <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Binocular Instruments</a></span>; the
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Stereoscope</a></span> may be placed in this category; the optical
action of the Zoétrope, with its modern development the
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Cinematograph</a></span>, depends upon the physiological persistence
of <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Vision</a></span>. Meteorological optical phenomena comprise the
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Corona</a></span>, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Halo</a></span>, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Mirage</a></span>, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Rainbow</a></span>, colour of <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Sky</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Twilight</a></span>,
and also astronomical refraction (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Refraction, Astronomical</a></span>);
the complete theory of the corona involves <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Diffraction</a></span>,
and atmospheric <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Dust</a></span> also plays a part in this group
of phenomena.</p>

<p class="pt2 center">I. <span class="sc">History</span></p>

<p>§ 1. There is reason to believe that the ancients were more
familiar with optics than with any other branch of physics;
and this may be due to the fact that for a knowledge of external
things man is indebted to the sense of vision in a far greater
degree than to other senses. That light travels in straight
lines&mdash;or, in other words, that an object is seen in the direction
in which it really lies&mdash;must have been realized in very remote
times. The antiquity of mirrors points to some acquaintance
with the phenomena of reflection, and Layard&rsquo;s discovery
of a convex lens of rock-crystal among the ruins of the palace
of Nimrud implies a knowledge of the burning and magnifying
powers of this instrument. The Greeks were acquainted with
the fundamental law of reflection, viz. the equality of the angles
of incidence and reflection; and it was Hero of Alexandria who
proved that the path of the ray is the least possible. The lens,
as an instrument for magnifying objects or for concentrating
rays to effect combustion, was also known. Aristophanes,
in the <i>Clouds</i> (<i>c.</i> 424 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), mentions the use of the burning-glass
to destroy the writing on a waxed tablet; much later, Pliny
describes such glasses as solid balls of rock-crystal or glass,
or hollow glass balls filled with water, and Seneca mentions their
use by engravers. A treatise on optics (<span class="grk" title="Katoptrika">&#922;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#960;&#964;&#961;&#953;&#954;&#940;</span>), assigned
to Euclid by Proclus and Marinus, shows that the Greeks were
acquainted with the production of images by plane, cylindrical
and concave and convex spherical mirrors, but it is doubtful
whether Euclid was the author, since neither this work nor
the <span class="grk" title="Optika">&#8008;&#960;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#940;</span>, a work treating of vision and also assigned to him
by Proclus and Marinus, is mentioned by Pappus, and more
particularly since the demonstrations do not exhibit the precision
of his other writings.</p>

<p>Reflection, or catoptrics, was the key-note of their explanations
of optical phenomena; it is to the reflection of solar
rays by the air that Aristotle ascribed twilight, and from his
observation of the colours formed by light falling on spray,
he attributes the rainbow to reflection from drops of rain.
Although certain elementary phenomena of refraction had
also been noted&mdash;such as the apparent bending of an oar at
the point where it met the water, and the apparent elevation
of a coin in a basin by filling the basin with water&mdash;the quantitative
law of refraction was unknown; in fact, it was not formulated
until the beginning of the 17th century. The analysis
of white light into the continuous spectrum of rainbow colours
by transmission through a prism was observed by Seneca, who
regarded the colours as fictitious, placing them in the same
category as the iridescent appearance of the feathers on a
pigeon&rsquo;s neck.</p>

<p>§ 2. The aversion of the Greek thinkers to detailed experimental
inquiry stultified the progress of the science; instead
of acquiring facts necessary for formulating scientific laws
and correcting hypotheses, the Greeks devoted their intellectual
energies to philosophizing on the nature of light itself. In their
search for a theory the Greeks were mainly concerned with
vision&mdash;in other words, they sought to determine how an object
was seen, and to what its colour was due. Emission theories,
involving the conception that light was a stream of concrete
particles, were formulated. The Pythagoreans assumed that
vision and colour were caused by the bombardment of the eye
by minute particles projected from the surface of the object
seen. The Platonists subsequently introduced three elements&mdash;a
stream of particles emitted by the eye (their &ldquo;divine fire&rdquo;),
which united with the solar rays, and, after the combination
had met a stream from the object, returned to the eye and
excited vision.</p>

<p>In some form or other the emission theory&mdash;that light was a
longitudinal propulsion of material particles&mdash;dominated optical
thought until the beginning of the 19th century. The authority
of the Platonists was strong enough to overcome Aristotle&rsquo;s
theory that light was an activity (<span class="grk" title="energeia">&#7952;&#957;&#941;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#945;</span>) of a medium which
he termed the <i>pellucid</i> (<span class="grk" title="diaphanes">&#948;&#953;&#945;&#966;&#945;&#957;&#941;&#962;</span>); about two thousand years
later Newton&rsquo;s exposition of his corpuscular theory overcame
the undulatory hypotheses of Descartes and Huygens; and it
was only after the acquisition of new experimental facts that the
labours of Thomas Young and Augustin Fresnel indubitably
established the wave-theory.</p>

<p>§ 3. The experimental study of refraction, which had been
almost entirely neglected by the early Greeks, received more
attention during the opening centuries of the Christian era.
Cleomedes, in his <i>Cyclical Theory of Meteors</i>, <i>c.</i> <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 50, alludes
to the apparent bending of a stick partially immersed in water,
and to the rendering visible of coins in basins by filling up with
water; and also remarks that the air may refract the sun&rsquo;s
rays so as to render that luminary visible, although actually
it may be below the horizon. The most celebrated of the early
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page611" id="page611"></a>611</span>
writers on optics is the Alexandrian Ptolemy (2nd century).
His writings on light are believed to be preserved in two imperfect
Latin manuscripts, themselves translations from the Arabic.
The subjects discussed include the nature of light and colour;
the formation of images by various types of mirrors, refractions
at the surface of glass and of water, with tables of the angle
of refraction corresponding to given angles of incidence for rays
passing from air to glass and from air to water; and also astronomical
refractions, <i>i.e.</i> the apparent displacement of a heavenly
body due to the refraction of light in its passage through the
atmosphere. The authenticity of these manuscripts has been
contested: the <i>Almagest</i> contains no mention of the <i>Optics</i>,
nor is the subject of astronomical refractions noticed, but the
strongest objection, according to A. de Morgan, is the fact that
their author was a poor geometer.</p>

<p>§ 4. One of the results of the decadence of the Roman empire
was the suppression of the academies, and few additions were
made to scientific knowledge on European soil until the 13th
century. Extinguished in the West, the spirit of research was
kindled in the East. The accession of the Arabs to power and
territory in the 7th century was followed by the acquisition of
the literary stores of Greece, and during the following five
centuries the Arabs, both by their preservation of existing
works and by their original discoveries (which, however, were
but few), took a permanent place in the history of science.
Pre-eminent among Arabian scientists is Alhazen, who flourished
in the 11th century. Primarily a mathematician and astronomer,
he also investigated a wide range of optical phenomena. He
examined the anatomy of the eye, and the functions of its several
parts in promoting vision; and explained how it is that we see
one object with two eyes, and then not by a single ray or beam
as had been previously held, but by two cones of rays proceeding
from the object, one to each eye. He attributed vision to
emanations from the body seen; and on his authority the
Platonic theory fell into disrepute. He also discussed the
magnifying powers of lenses; and it may be that his writings
on this subject inspired the subsequent invention of spectacles.
Astronomical observations led to the investigation of refraction
by the atmosphere, in particular, astronomical refraction; he
explained the phenomenon of twilight, and showed a connexion
between its duration and the height of the atmosphere. He also
treated <i>optical deceptions</i>, both in direct vision and in vision by
reflected and refracted light, including the phenomenon known
as the <i>horizontal moon</i>, <i>i.e.</i> the apparent increase in the diameter
of the sun or moon when near the horizon. This appearance
had been explained by Ptolemy on the supposition that the
diameter was actually increased by refraction, and his commentator
Theon endeavoured to explain why an object appears
larger when viewed under water. But actual experiment showed
that the diameter did not increase. Alhazen gave the correct
explanation, which, however, Friar Bacon attributes to Ptolemy.
We judge of distance by comparing the angle under which an
object is seen with its supposed distance, so that if two objects
be seen under nearly equal angles and one be supposed to be
more distant than the other, then the former will be supposed
to be the larger. When near the horizon the sun or moon,
conceived as very distant, are intuitively compared with terrestrial
objects, and therefore they appear larger than when viewed
at elevations.</p>

<p>§ 5. While the Arabs were acting as the custodians of scientific
knowledge, the institutions and civilizations of Europe were
gradually crystallizing. Attacked by the Mongols and by the
Crusaders, the Bagdad caliphate disappeared in the 13th century.
At that period the Arabic commentaries, which had already been
brought to Europe, were beginning to exert great influence on
scientific thought; and it is probable that their rarity and the
increasing demand for the originals and translations led to
those forgeries which are of frequent occurrence in the literature
of the middle ages. The first treatise on optics written in Europe
was admitted by its author Vitello or Vitellio, a native of Poland,
to be based on the works of Ptolemy and Alhazen. It was written
in about 1270, and first published in 1572, with a Latin translation
of Alhazen&rsquo;s treatise, by F. Risner, under the title <i>Thesaurus
opticae</i>. Its tables of refraction are more accurate than Ptolemy&rsquo;s;
the author follows Alhazen in his investigation of lenses, but his
determinations of the foci and magnifying powers of spheres
are inaccurate. He attributed the twinkling of stars to refraction
by moving air, and observed that the scintillation was increased
by viewing through water in gentle motion; he also recognized
that both reflection and refraction were instrumental in producing
the rainbow, but he gave no explanation of the colours.</p>

<p>The <i>Perspectiva Communis</i> of John Peckham, archbishop of
Canterbury, being no more than a collection of elementary
propositions containing nothing new, we have next to consider
the voluminous works of Vitellio&rsquo;s illustrious contemporary,
Roger Bacon. His writings on light, <i>Perspectiva</i> and <i>Specula
mathematica</i>, are included in his <i>Opus majus</i>. It is conceivable
that he was acquainted with the nature of the images formed
by light traversing a small orifice&mdash;a phenomenon noticed by
Aristotle, and applied at a later date to the construction of the
camera obscura. The invention of the magic lantern has been
ascribed to Bacon, and his statements concerning spectacles,
the telescope, and the microscope, if not based on an experimental
realization of these instruments, must be regarded as masterly
conceptions of the applications of lenses. As to the nature of
light, Bacon adhered to the theory that objects are rendered
visible by emanations from the eye.</p>

<p>The history of science, and more particularly the history of
inventions, constantly confronts us with the problem presented
by such writings as Friar Bacon&rsquo;s. Rarely has it been given to
one man to promote an entirely new theory or to devise an
original instrument; it is more generally the case that, in the
evolution of a single idea, there comes some stage which arrests
our attention, and to which we assign the dignity of an &ldquo;invention.&rdquo;
Furthermore, the obscurity that surrounds the early
history of spectacles, the magic lantern, the telescope and the
microscope, may find a partial solution in the spirit of the middle
ages. The natural philosopher who was bold enough to present
to a prince a pair of spectacles or a telescope would be in imminent
danger of being regarded in the eyes of the church as a powerful
and dangerous magician; and it is conceivable that the maker
of such an instrument would jealously guard the secret of its
actual construction, however much he might advertise its
potentialities.<a name="fa3n" id="fa3n" href="#ft3n"><span class="sp">3</span></a></p>

<p>§ 6. The awakening of Europe, which first manifested itself
in Italy, England and France, was followed in the 16th century
by a period of increasing intellectual activity. The need for
experimental inquiry was realized, and a tendency to dispute
the dogmatism of the church and to question the theories of
the established schools of philosophy became apparent. In the
science of optics, Italy led the van, the foremost pioneers being
Franciscus Maurolycus (1494-1575) of Messina, and Giambattista
della Porta (1538-1615) of Naples. A treatise by Maurolycus
entitled <i>Photismi de Lumine et Umbra prospectivum radiorum
incidentium facientes</i> (1575), contains a discussion of the measurement
of the intensity of light&mdash;an early essay in photometry;
the formation of circular patches of light by small holes of any
shape, with a correct explanation of the phenomenon; and the
optical relations of the parts of the eye, maintaining that
the crystalline humour acts as a lens which focuses images on
the retina, explaining short- and long-sight (myopia and hyper-metropia),
with the suggestion that the former may be corrected
by concave, and the latter by convex, lenses. He observed the
spherical aberration due to elements beyond the axis of a lens,
and also the caustics of refraction (diacaustics) by a sphere
(seen as the bright boundaries of the luminous patches formed
by receiving the transmitted light on a screen), which he correctly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page612" id="page612"></a>612</span>
regarded as determined by the intersections of the refracted rays.
His researches on refraction were less fruitful; he assumed the
angles of incidence and refraction to be in the constant ratio
of 8 to 5, and the rainbow, in which he recognized four colours,
orange, green, blue and purple, to be formed by rays reflected
in the drops along the sides of an octagon. Porta&rsquo;s fame rests
chiefly on his <i>Magia naturalis sive de miraculis rerum naturalium</i>,
of which four books were published in 1558, the complete work
of twenty books appearing in 1589. It attained great popularity,
perhaps by reason of its astonishing medley of subjects&mdash;pyrotechnics
and perfumery, animal reproduction and hunting,
alchemy and optics,&mdash;and it was several times reprinted, and
translated into English (with the title <i>Natural Magick</i>, 1658),
German, French, Spanish, Hebrew and Arabic. The work
contains an account of the camera obscura, with the invention of
which the author has sometimes been credited; but, whoever
the inventor, Porta was undoubtedly responsible for improving
and popularizing that instrument, and also the magic lantern.
In the same work practical applications of lenses are suggested,
combinations comparable with telescopes are vaguely treated
and spectacles are discussed. His <i>De Refractione, optices parte</i>
(1593) contains an account of binocular vision, in which are
found indications of the principle of the stereoscope.</p>

<p>§ 7. The empirical study of lenses led, in the opening decade
of the 17th century, to the emergence of the telescope from its
former obscurity. The first form, known as the Dutch or Galileo
telescope, consisted of a convex and a concave lens, a combination
which gave erect images; the later form, now known as the
&ldquo;Keplerian&rdquo; or &ldquo;astronomical&rdquo; telescope (in contrast with
the earlier or &ldquo;terrestrial&rdquo; telescope) consisted of two convex
lenses, which gave inverted images. With the microscope, too,
advances were made, and it seems probable that the compound
type came into common use about this time. These single
instruments were followed by the invention of binoculars, <i>i.e.</i>
instruments which permitted simultaneous vision with both eyes.
There is little doubt that the experimental realization of the
telescope, opening up as it did such immense fields for astronomical
research, stimulated the study of lenses and optical systems.
The investigations of Maurolycus were insufficient to explain
the theory of the telescope, and it was Kepler who first determined
the principle of the Galilean telescope in his <i>Dioptrice</i> (1611),
which also contains the first description of the astronomical or
Keplerian telescope, and the demonstration that rays parallel
to the axis of a plano-convex lens come to a focus at a point on
the axis distant twice the radius of the curved surface of the lens,
and, in the case of an equally convex lens, at an axial point
distant only once the radius. He failed, however, to determine
accurately the case for unequally convex lenses, a problem
which was solved by Bonaventura Cavalieri, a pupil of Galileo.</p>

<p>Early in the 17th century great efforts were made to determine
the law of refraction. Kepler, in his <i>Prolegomena ad Vitellionem</i>
(1604), assiduously, but unsuccessfully, searched for the law,
and can only be credited with twenty-seven empirical rules,
really of the nature of approximations, which he employed in his
theory of lenses. The true law&mdash;that the ratio of the sines of the
angles of incidence and refraction is constant&mdash;was discovered
in 1621 by Willebrord Snell (1591-1626); but was published
for the first time after his death, and with no mention of his name,
by Descartes. Whereas in Snell&rsquo;s manuscript the law was stated
in the form of the ratio of certain lines, trigonometrically interpretable
as a ratio of cosecants, Descartes expressed the law in
its modern trigonometrical form, viz. as the ratio of the sines.
It may be observed that the modern form was independently
obtained by James Gregory and published in his <i>Optica promota</i>
(1663). Armed with the law of refraction, Descartes determined
the geometrical theory of the primary and secondary rainbows,
but did not mention how far he was indebted to the explanation
of the primary bow by Antonio de Dominis in 1611; and,
similarly, in his additions to the knowledge of the telescope
the influence of Galileo is not recorded.</p>

<p>§ 8. In his metaphysical speculations on the system of nature,
Descartes formulated a theory of light at variance with the generally
accepted emission theory and showing some resemblance to
the earlier views of Aristotle, and, in a smaller measure, to the
modern undulatory theory. He imagined light to be a pressure
transmitted by an infinitely elastic medium which pervades
space, and colour to be due to rotatory motions of the particles
of this medium. He attempted a mechanical explanation of the
law of refraction, and came to the conclusion that light passed
more readily through a more highly refractive medium. This
view was combated by Pierre de Fermat (1601-1665), who, from
the principle known as the &ldquo;law of least time,&rdquo; deduced the
converse to be the case, <i>i.e.</i> that the velocity varied inversely
with the refractive index. In brief, Fermat&rsquo;s argument was as
follows: Since nature performs her operations by the most
direct routes or shortest paths, then the path of a ray of light
between any two points must be such that the time occupied in
the passage is a minimum. The rectilinear propagation and the
law of reflection obviously agree with this principle, and it
remained to be proved whether the law of refraction tallied.</p>

<p>Although Fermat&rsquo;s premiss is useless, his inference is invaluable,
and the most notable application of it was made in about 1824
by Sir William Rowan Hamilton, who merged it into his conception
of the &ldquo;characteristic function,&rdquo; by the help of which all
optical problems, whether on the corpuscular or on the undulator
theory, are solved by one common process. Hamilton was in
possession of the germs of this grand theory some years before
1824, but it was first communicated to the Royal Irish Academy
in that year, and published in imperfect instalments some years
later. The following is his own description of it. It is of interest
as exhibiting the origin of Fermat&rsquo;s deduction, its relation to
contemporary and subsequent knowledge, and its connexion
with other analytical principles. Moreover, it is important as
showing Hamilton&rsquo;s views on a very singular part of the
more modern history of the science to which he contributed
so much.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>&ldquo;Those who have meditated on the beauty and utility, in theoretical
mechanics, of the general method of Lagrange, who have felt
the power and dignity of that central dynamical theorem which he
deduced, in the <i>Mécanique analytique</i> ..., must feel that mathematical
optics can only then attain a coordinate rank with mathematical
mechanics ..., when it shall possess an appropriate
method, and become the unfolding of a central idea.... It appears
that if a general method in deductive optics can be attained
at all, it must flow from some law or principle, itself of the highest
generality, and among the highest results of induction.... [This]
must be the principle, or law, called usually the Law of Least
Action; suggested by questionable views, but established on the
widest induction, and embracing every known combination of media,
and every straight, or bent, or curved line, ordinary or extraordinary,
along which light (whatever light may be) extends its influence successively
in space and time: namely, that this linear path of light,
from one point to another, is always found to be such that, if it be
compared with the other infinitely various lines by which in thought
and in geometry the same two points might be connected, a certain
integral or sum, called often <i>Action</i>, and depending by fixed rules
on the length, and shape, and position of the path, and on the media
which are traversed by it, is less than all the similar integrals for
the other neighbouring lines, or, at least, possesses, with respect to
them, a certain <i>stationary</i> property. From this Law, then, which
may, perhaps, be named the <span class="sc">Law of Stationary Action</span>, it seems
that we may most fitly and with best hope set out, in the synthetic
or deductive process and in the search of a mathematical method.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Accordingly, from this known law of least or stationary action
I deduced (long since) another connected and coextensive principle,
which may be called by analogy the <span class="sc">Law of Varying Action</span>,
and which seems to offer naturally a method such as we are seeking;
the one law being as it were the last step in the ascending scale of
induction, respecting linear paths of light, while the other law may
usefully be made the first in the descending and deductive way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The former of these two laws was discovered in the following
manner. The elementary principle of straight rays showed that
light, under the most simple and usual circumstances, employs the
direct, and therefore the shortest, course to pass from one point
to another. Again, it was a very early discovery (attributed by
Laplace to Ptolemy), that, in the case of a plane mirror, the bent
line formed by the incident and reflected rays is shorter than any
other bent line having the same extremities, and having its point
of bending on the mirror. These facts were thought by some to be
instances and results of the simplicity and economy of nature; and
Fermat, whose researches on maxima and minima are claimed by
the Continental mathematicians as the germ of the differential
calculus, sought anxiously to trace some similar economy in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page613" id="page613"></a>613</span>
more complex case of refraction. He believed that by a metaphysical
or cosmological necessity, arising from the simplicity of the
universe, light always takes the course which it can traverse in the
shortest time. To reconcile this metaphysical opinion with the law
of refraction, discovered experimentally by Snellius, Fermat was
led to suppose that the two lengths, or <i>indices</i>, which Snellius had
measured on the incident ray prolonged and on the refracted ray,
and had observed to have one common projection on a refracting
plane, are inversely proportional to the two successive velocities of
the light before and after refraction, and therefore that the velocity
of light is diminished on entering those denser media in which it is
observed to approach the perpendicular; for Fermat believed that
the time of propagation of light along a line bent by refraction was
represented by the sum of the two products, of the incident portion
multiplied by the index of the first medium and of the refracted
portion multiplied by the index of the second medium; because he
found, by his mathematical method, that this sum was less, in the
case of a plane refractor, than if light went by any other than its
actual path from one given point to another, and because he perceived
that the supposition of a velocity inversely as the index
reconciled his mathematical discovery of the minimum of the foregoing
sum with his cosmological principle of least time. Descartes
attacked Fermat&rsquo;s opinions respecting light, but Leibnitz zealously
defended them; and Huygens was led, by reasonings of a very
different kind, to adopt Fermat&rsquo;s conclusions of a velocity inversely
as the index, and of a <i>minimum time</i> of propagation of light, in
passing from one given point to another through an ordinary refracting
plane. Newton, however, by his theory of emission and
attraction, was led to conclude that the velocity of light was <i>directly</i>,
not <i>inversely</i>, as the index, and that it was <i>increased</i> instead of
being <i>diminished</i> on entering a denser medium; a result incompatible
with the theorem of the shortest time in refraction. This
theorem of shortest time was accordingly abandoned by many,
and among the rest by Maupertuis, who, however, proposed in its
stead, as a new cosmological principle, that <i>celebrated law of least
action</i> which has since acquired so high a rank in mathematical
physics, by the improvements of Euler and Lagrange.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>§ 9. The second half of the 17th century witnessed developments
in the practice and theory of optics which equal in importance
the mathematical, chemical and astronomical acquisitions
of the period. Original observations were made which led to
the discovery, in an embryonic form, of new properties of light,
and the development of mathematical analysis facilitated the
quantitative and theoretical investigation of these properties.
Indeed, mathematical and physical optics may justly be dated
from this time. The phenomenon of <i>diffraction</i>, so named by
Grimaldi, and by Newton <i>inflection</i>, which may be described
briefly as the spreading out, or deviation, from the strictly
rectilinear path of light passing through a small aperture or
beyond the edge of an opaque object, was discovered by the
Italian Jesuit, Francis Maria Grimaldi (1619-1663), and published
in his <i>Physico-Mathesis de Lumine</i> (1665); at about the
same time Newton made his classical investigation of the spectrum
or the band of colours formed when light is transmitted through
a prism,<a name="fa4n" id="fa4n" href="#ft4n"><span class="sp">4</span></a> and studied <i>interference</i> phenomena in the form of the
colours of thin and thick plates, and in the form now termed
<i>Newton&rsquo;s rings</i>; <i>double refraction</i>, in the form of the dual images
of a single object formed by a rhomb of Iceland spar, was discovered
by Bartholinus in 1670; Huygens&rsquo;s examination of the
transmitted beams led to the discovery of an absence of symmetry
now called <i>polarization</i>; and the finite velocity of light was
deduced in 1676 by Ole Roemer from the comparison of the
observed and computed times of the eclipses of the moons of
Jupiter.</p>

<p>These discoveries had a far-reaching influence upon the
theoretical views which had been previously held: for instance,
Newton&rsquo;s recombination of the spectrum by means of a second
(inverted) prism caused the rejection of the earlier view that the
prism actually manufactured the colours, and led to the acceptance
of the theory that the colours were physically present in
the white light, the function of the prism being merely to separate
the physical mixture; and Roemer&rsquo;s discovery of the finite
velocity of light introduced the necessity of considering the
momentum of the particles which, on the accepted emission
theory, composed the light. Of greater moment was the controversy
concerning the emission or corpuscular theory championed
by Newton and the undulatory theory presented by Huygens
(see section II. of this article). In order to explain the colours
of thin plates Newton was forced to abandon some of the original
simplicity of his theory; and we may observe that by postulating
certain motions for the Newtonian corpuscles all the phenomena
of light can be explained, these motions aggregating to a transverse
displacement, translated longitudinally, and the corpuscles,
at the same time, becoming otiose and being replaced by a
medium in which the vibration is transmitted. In this way
the Newtonian theory may be merged into the undulatory
theory. Newton&rsquo;s results are collected in his <i>Opticks</i>, the first
edition of which appeared in 1704. Huygens published his
theory in his <i>Traité de lumière</i> (1690), where he explained
reflection, refraction and double refraction, but did not elucidate
the formation of shadows (which was readily explicable on the
Newtonian hypothesis) or polarization; and it was this inability
to explain polarization which led to Newton&rsquo;s rejection of the
wave theory. The authority of Newton and his masterly
exposition of the corpuscular theory sustained that theory
until the beginning of the 19th century, when it succumbed to
the assiduous skill of Young and Fresnel.</p>

<p>§ 10. Simultaneously with this remarkable development of
theoretical and experimental optics, notable progress was made
in the construction of optical instruments. The increased
demand for telescopes, occasioned by the interest in observational
astronomy, led to improvements in the grinding of lenses (the
primary aim being to obtain forms in which spherical aberration
was a minimum), and also to the study of achromatism, the
principles of which followed from Newton&rsquo;s analysis and <span class="correction" title="amended from snythesis">synthesis</span>
of white light. Kepler&rsquo;s supposition that lenses having the form
of surfaces of revolution of the conic sections would bring rays
to a focus without spherical aberration was investigated by
Descartes, and the success of the latter&rsquo;s demonstration led to the
grinding of ellipsoidal and hyperboloidal lenses, but with disappointing
results.<a name="fa5n" id="fa5n" href="#ft5n"><span class="sp">5</span></a> The grinding of spherical lenses was greatly
improved by Huygens, who also attempted to reduce chromatic
aberration in the refracting telescope by introducing a stop
(<i>i.e.</i> by restricting the aperture of the rays); to the same experimenter
are due compound eye-pieces, the invention of which
had been previously suggested by Eustachio Divini. The so-called
Huygenian eye-piece is composed of two plano-convex
lenses with their plane faces towards the eye; the field-glass
has a focal length three times that of the eye-glass, and the
distance between them is twice the focal length of the eye-glass.
Huygens observed that spherical aberration was diminished
by making the deviations of the rays at the two lenses equal,
and Ruggiero Giuseppe Boscovich subsequently pointed out
that the combination was achromatic. The true development,
however, of the achromatic refracting telescope, which followed
from the introduction of compound object-glasses giving no
dispersion, dates from about the middle of the 18th century.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page614" id="page614"></a>614</span>
The difficulty of obtaining lens systems in which aberrations
were minimized, and the theory of Newton that colour production
invariably attended refraction, led to the manufacture of improved
specula which permitted the introduction of reflecting
telescopes. The idea of this type of instrument had apparently
occurred to Marin Mersenne in about 1640, but the first reflector
of note was described in 1663 by James Gregory in his <i>Optica
promota</i>; a second type was invented by Newton, and a
third in 1672 by Cassegrain. Slight improvements were made
in the microscope, although the achromatic type did
not appear until about 1820, some sixty years after John
Dollond had determined the principle of the achromatic
telescope (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Aberration</a></span>, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Telescope</a></span>, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Microscope</a></span>, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Binocular
Instrument</a></span>).</p>

<p>§ 11. Passing over the discovery by Ehrenfried Walther
Tschirnhausen (1651-1708) of the caustics produced by reflection
(&ldquo;catacaustics&rdquo;) and his experiments with large reflectors and
refractors (for the manufacture of which he established glass-works
in Italy); James Bradley&rsquo;s discovery in 1728 of the
&ldquo;aberration of light,&rdquo; with the subsequent derivation of the
velocity of light, the value agreeing fairly well with Roemer&rsquo;s
estimate; the foundation of scientific photometry by Pierre
Bouguer in an essay published in 1729 and expanded in 1760
into his <i>Traité d&rsquo;optique sur la graduation de la lumière</i>; the
publication of John Henry Lambert&rsquo;s treatise on the same subject,
entitled <i>Photometria, sive de Mensura et Gradibus Luminis,
Colorum et Umbrae</i> (1760); and the development of the telescope
and other optical instruments, we arrive at the closing decades
of the 18th century. During the forty years 1780 to 1820 the
history of optics is especially marked by the names of Thomas
Young and Augustin Fresnel, and in a lesser degree by Arago,
Malus, Sir William Herschel, Fraunhofer, Wollaston, Biot and
Brewster.</p>

<p>Although the corpuscular theory had been disputed by
Benjamin Franklin, Leonhard Euler and others, the authority
of Newton retained for it an almost general acceptance until
the beginning of the 19th century, when Young and Fresnel
instituted their destructive criticism. Basing his views on
the earlier undulatory theories and diffraction phenomena of
Grimaldi and Hooke, Young accepted the Huygenian theory,
assuming, from a false analogy with sound waves, that the wave-disturbance
was longitudinal, and ignoring the suggestion
made by Hooke in 1672 that the direction of the vibration might
be transverse, <i>i.e.</i> at right angles to the direction of the rays.
As with Huygens, Young was unable to explain diffraction
correctly, or polarization. But the assumption enabled him to
establish the principle of interference,<a name="fa6n" id="fa6n" href="#ft6n"><span class="sp">6</span></a> one of the most fertile
in the science of physical optics. The undulatory theory was
also accepted by Fresnel who, perceiving the inadequacy of the
researches of Huygens and Young, showed in 1818 by an analysis
which, however, is not quite free from objection, that, by assuming
that every element of a wave-surface could act as a source of
secondary waves or wavelets, the diffraction bands were due
to the interference of the secondary waves formed by each element
of a primary wave falling upon the edge of an obstacle or aperture.
One consequence of Fresnel&rsquo;s theory was that the bands were
independent of the nature of the diffracting edge&mdash;a fact confirmed
by experiment and therefore invalidating Young&rsquo;s theory that
the bands were produced by the interference between the
primary wave and the wave reflected from the edge of the
obstacle. Another consequence, which was first mathematically
deduced by Poisson and subsequently confirmed by experiment,
is the paradoxical phenomenon that a small circular
disk illuminated by a point source casts a shadow having a
bright centre.</p>

<p>§ 12. The undulatory theory reached its zenith when Fresnel
explained the complex phenomena of polarization, by adopting
the conception of Hooke that the vibrations were transverse,
and not longitudinal.<a name="fa7n" id="fa7n" href="#ft7n"><span class="sp">7</span></a> Polarization by double refraction had
been investigated by Huygens, and the researches of Wollaston
and, more especially, of Young, gave such an impetus to the study
that the Institute of France made double refraction the subject
of a prize essay in 1812. E. L. Malus (1775-1812) discovered
the phenomenon of polarization by reflection about 1808 and
investigated metallic reflection; Arago discovered circular
polarization in quartz in 1811, and, with Fresnel, made many
experimental investigations, which aided the establishment of the
Fresnel-Arago laws of the interference of polarized beams;
Biot introduced a reflecting polariscope, investigated the colours
of crystalline plates and made many careful researches on the
rotation of the plane of polarization; Sir David Brewster made
investigations over a wide range, and formulated the law connecting
the angle of polarization with the refractive index of
the reflecting medium. Fresnel&rsquo;s theory was developed in a
strikingly original manner by Sir William Rowan Hamilton,
who interpreted from Fresnel&rsquo;s analytical determination of the
geometrical form of the wave-surface in biaxal crystals the
existence of two hitherto unrecorded phenomena. At Hamilton&rsquo;s
instigation Humphrey Lloyd undertook the experimental search,
and brought to light the phenomena of external and internal
conical refraction.</p>

<p>The undulatory vibration postulated by Fresnel having been
generally accepted as explaining most optical phenomena, it
became necessary to determine the mechanical properties
of the aether which transmits this motion. Fresnel, Neumann,
Cauchy, MacCullagh, and, especially, Green and Stokes, developed
the &ldquo;elastic-solid theory.&rdquo; By applying the theory of elasticity
they endeavoured to determine the constants of a medium which
could transmit waves of the nature of light. Many different
allocations were suggested (of which one of the most recent
is Lord Kelvin&rsquo;s &ldquo;contractile aether,&rdquo; which, however, was
afterwards discarded by its author), and the theory as left by
Green and Stokes has merits other than purely historical. At
a later date theories involving an action between the aether
and material atoms were proposed, the first of any moment
being J. Boussinesq&rsquo;s (1867). C. Christiansen&rsquo;s investigation of
anomalous dispersion in 1870, and the failure of Cauchy&rsquo;s formula
(founded on the elastic-solid theory) to explain this phenomenon,
led to the theories of W. Sellmeier (1872), H. von Helmholtz
(1875), E. Ketteler (1878), E. Lommel (1878) and W. Voigt
(1883). A third class of theory, to which the present-day theory
belongs, followed from Clerk Maxwell&rsquo;s analytical investigations
in electromagnetics. Of the greatest exponents of this theory
we may mention H. A. Lorentz, P. Drude and J. Larmor, while
Lord Rayleigh has, with conspicuous brilliancy, explained
several phenomena (<i>e.g.</i> the colour of the sky) on this hypothesis.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>For a critical examination of these theories see section II. of this
article; reference may also be made to the <i>British Association
Reports</i>: &ldquo;On Physical Optics,&rdquo; by Humphrey Lloyd (1834),

<p>§ 13. <i>Recent Developments.</i>&mdash;The determination of the velocity
of light (see section III. of this article) may be regarded as
definitely settled, a result contributed to by A. H. L. Fizeau
(1849), J. B. L. Foucault (1850, 1862), A. Cornu (1874), A. A.
Michelson (1880), James Young and George Forbes (1882),
Simon Newcomb (1880-1882) and Cornu (1900). The velocity
in moving media was investigated theoretically by Fresnel;
and Fizeau (1859), and Michelson and Morley (1886) showed
experimentally that the velocity was increased in running water
by an amount agreeing with Fresnel&rsquo;s formula, which was based
on the hypothesis of a stationary aether. The optics of moving
media have also been investigated by Lord Rayleigh, and more
especially by H. A. Lorentz, who also assumed a stationary
aether. The relative motion of the earth and the aether has an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page615" id="page615"></a>615</span>
important connexion with the phenomenon of the aberration
of light, and has been treated with masterly skill by Joseph
Larmor and others (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Aether</a></span>). The relation of the earth&rsquo;s
motion to the intensities of terrestrial sources of light was
investigated theoretically by Fizeau, but no experimental inquiry
was made until 1903, when Nordmeyer obtained negative results,
which were confirmed by the theoretical investigations of A. A.
Bucherer and H. A. Lorentz.</p>

<p>Experimental photometry has been greatly developed since
the pioneer work of Bouguer and Lambert and the subsequent
introduction of the photometers of Ritchie, Rumford, Bunsen
and Wheatstone, followed by Swan&rsquo;s in 1859, and O. R. Lummer
and E. Brodhun&rsquo;s instrument (essentially the same as Swan&rsquo;s)
in 1889. This expansion may largely be attributed to the
increase in the number of artificial illuminants&mdash;especially the
many types of filament- and arc-electric lights, and the incandescent
gas light. Colour photometry has also been notably
developed, especially since the enunciation of the &ldquo;Purkinje
phenomenon&rdquo; in 1825. Sir William Abney has contributed
much to this subject, and A. M. Meyer has designed a photometer
in which advantage is taken of the phenomenon of contrast
colours. &ldquo;Flicker photometry&rdquo; may be dated from O. N.
Rood&rsquo;s investigations in 1893, and the same principle has been
applied by Haycraft and Whitman. These questions&mdash;colour and
flicker photometry&mdash;have important affinities to colour perception
and the persistence of vision (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Vision</a></span>). The spectrophotometer,
devised by De Witt Bristol Brace in 1899, which permits
the comparison of similarly coloured portions of the spectra
from two different sources, has done much valuable work in the
determination of absorptive powers and extinction coefficients.
Much attention has also been given to the preparation of a
standard of intensity, and many different sources have been
introduced (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Photometry</a></span>). Stellar photometry, which was
first investigated instrumentally with success by Sir John
Herschel, was greatly improved by the introduction of Zöllner&rsquo;s
photometer, E. C. Pickering&rsquo;s meridian photometer and C.
Pritchard&rsquo;s wedge photometer. Other methods of research in
this field are by photography&mdash;photographic photometry&mdash;and
radiometric method (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Photometry, Celestial</a></span>).</p>

<p>The earlier methods for the experimental determination of
refractive indices by measuring the deviation through a solid
prism of the substance in question or, in the case of liquids,
through a hollow prism containing the liquid, have been replaced
in most accurate work by other methods. The method of
total reflection, due originally to Wollaston, has been put into a
very convenient form, applicable to both solids and liquids, in
the Pulfrich refractometer (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Refraction</a></span>). Still more accurate
methods, based on interference phenomena, have been devised.
Jamin&rsquo;s interference refractometer is one of the earlier forms
of such apparatus; and Michelson&rsquo;s interferometer is one of the
best of later types (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Interference</a></span>). The variation of refractive
index with density has been the subject of much experimental
and theoretical inquiry. The empirical rule of Gladstone
and Dale was often at variance with experiment, and the mathematical
investigations of H. A. Lorentz of Leiden and L. Lorenz
of Copenhagen on the electromagnetic theory led to a more
consistent formula. The experimental work has been chiefly
associated with the names of H. H. Landolt and J. W. Brühl,
whose results, in addition to verifying the Lorenz-Lorentz
formula, have established that this function of the refractive
index and density is a colligative property of the molecule, <i>i.e.</i>
it is calculable additively from the values of this function for
the component atoms, allowance being made for the mode in
which they are mutually combined (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Chemistry, Physical</a></span>).
The preparation of lenses, in which the refractive index decreases
with the distance from the axis, by K. F. J. Exner, H. F. L.
Matthiessen and Schott, and the curious results of refraction
by non-homogeneous media, as realized by R. Wood may be
mentioned (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Mirage</a></span>).</p>

<p>The spectrum of white light produced by prismatic refraction
has engaged many investigators. The infra-red or heat waves
were discovered by Sir William Herschel, and experiments on
the actinic effects of the different parts of the spectrum on
silver salts by Scheele, Senebier, Ritter, Seebeck and others,
proved the increased activity as one passed from the red to the
violet and the ultra-violet. Wollaston also made many investigations
in this field, noticing the dark lines&mdash;the &ldquo;Fraunhofer
lines&rdquo;&mdash;which cross the solar spectrum, which were further
discussed by Brewster and Fraunhofer, who thereby laid the
foundations of modern spectroscopy. Mention may also be
made of the investigations of Lord Rayleigh and Arthur Schuster
on the resolving power of prisms (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Diffraction</a></span>), and also
of the modern view of the function of the prism in analysing
white light. The infra-red and ultra-violet rays are of especial
interest since, although not affecting vision after the manner
of ordinary light, they possess very remarkable properties.
Theoretical investigation on the undulatory theory of the law
of reflection shows that a surface, too rough to give any trace
of regular reflection with ordinary light, may regularly reflect
the long waves, a phenomenon experimentally realized by
Lord Rayleigh. Long waves&mdash;the so-called &ldquo;residual rays&rdquo;
or &ldquo;<i>Rest-strahlen</i>&rdquo;&mdash;have also been isolated by repeated reflections
from quartz surfaces of the light from zirconia raised to
incandescence by the oxyhydrogen flame (E. F. Nichols and
H. Rubens); far longer waves were isolated by similar reflections
from fluorite (56 µ) and sylvite (61 µ) surfaces in 1899 by Rubens
and E. Aschkinass. The short waves&mdash;ultra-violet rays&mdash;have
also been studied, the researches of E. F. Nichols on the transparency
of quartz to these rays, which are especially present
in the radiations of the mercury arc, having led to the introduction
of lamps made of fused quartz, thus permitting the convenient
study of these rays, which, it is to be noted, are absorbed by
ordinary clear glass. Recent researches at the works of Schott
and Genossen, Jena, however, have resulted in the production
of a glass transparent to the ultra-violet.</p>

<p>Dispersion, <i>i.e.</i> that property of a substance which consists in
having a different refractive index for rays of different wave-lengths,
was first studied in the form known as &ldquo;ordinary
dispersion&rdquo; in which the refrangibility of the ray increased
with the wave-length. Cases had been observed by Fox Talbot,
Le Roux, and especially by Christiansen (1870) and A. Kundt
(1871-1872) where this normal rule did not hold; to such
phenomena the name &ldquo;anomalous dispersion&rdquo; was given, but
really there is nothing anomalous about it at all, ordinary
dispersion being merely a particular case of the general phenomenon.
The Cauchy formula, which was founded on the elastic-solid
theory, did not agree with the experimental facts, and the
germs of the modern theory, as was pointed out by Lord Rayleigh
in 1900, were embodied in a question proposed by Clerk Maxwell
for the Mathematical Tripos examination for 1869. The principle,
which occurred simultaneously to W. Sellmeier (who is regarded
as the founder of the modern theory) and had been employed
about 1850 by Sir G. G. Stokes to explain absorption lines,
involves an action between the aether and the molecules of the
dispersing substance. The mathematical investigation is associated
with the names of Sellmeier, Hermann Helmholtz, Eduard
Ketteler, P. Drude, H. A. Lorentz and Lord Rayleigh, and
the experimental side with many observers&mdash;F. Paschen,
Rubens and others; absorbing media have been investigated
by A. W. Pflüger, a great many aniline dyes by K. Stöckl, and
sodium vapour by R. W. Wood. Mention may also be made
of the beautiful experiments of Christiansen (1884) and Lord
Rayleigh on the colours transmitted by white powders suspended
in liquids of the same refractive index. If, for instance, benzol
be gradually added to finely powdered quartz, a succession of
beautiful colours&mdash;red, yellow, green and finally blue&mdash;is transmitted,
or, under certain conditions, the colours may appear
at once, causing the mixture to flash like a fiery opal. Absorption,
too, has received much attention; the theory has been especially
elaborated by M. Planck, and the experimental investigation
has been prosecuted from the purely physical standpoint, and
also from the standpoint of the physical chemist, with a view
to correlating absorption with constitution.</p>

<p>Interference phenomena have been assiduously studied. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page616" id="page616"></a>616</span>
experiments of Young, Fresnel, Lloyd, Fizeau and Foucault,
of Fresnel and Arago on the measurement of refractive indices
by the shift of the interference bands, of H. F. Talbot on the
&ldquo;Talbot bands&rdquo; (which he insufficiently explained on the
principle of interference, it being shown by Sir G. B. Airy that
diffraction phenomena supervene), of Baden-Powell on the
&ldquo;Powell bands,&rdquo; of David Brewster on &ldquo;Brewster&rsquo;s bands,&rdquo;
have been developed, together with many other phenomena&mdash;Newton&rsquo;s
rings, the colours of thin, thick and mixed plates, &amp;c.&mdash;in
a striking manner, one of the most important results being
the construction of interferometers applicable to the determination
of refractive indices and wave-lengths, with which the
names of Jamin, Michelson, Fabry and Perot, and of Lummer
and E. Gehrcke are chiefly associated. The mathematical
investigations of Fresnel may be regarded as being completed
by the analysis chiefly due to Airy, Stokes and Lord Rayleigh.
Mention may be made of Sir G. G. Stokes&rsquo; attribution of the
colours of iridescent crystals to periodic twinning; this view
has been confirmed by Lord Rayleigh (<i>Phil. Mag.</i>, 1888) who,
from the purity of the reflected light, concluded that the laminae
were equidistant by the order of a wave-length. Prior to 1891
only interference between waves proceeding in the same direction
had been studied. In that year Otto H. Wiener obtained, on a
film 1/20th of a wave-length in thickness, photographic impressions
of the stationary waves formed by the interference of waves
proceeding in opposite directions, and in 1892 Drude and Nernst
employed a fluorescent film to record the same phenomenon.
This principle is applied in the Lippmann colour photography,
which was suggested by W. Zenker, realized by Gabriel Lippmann,
and further investigated by R. G. Neuhauss, O. H. Wiener,
H. Lehmann and others.</p>

<p>Great progress has been made in the study of diffraction,
and &ldquo;this department of optics is precisely the one in which
the wave theory has secured its greatest triumphs&rdquo; (Lord
Rayleigh). The mathematical investigations of Fresnel and
Poisson were placed on a dynamical basis by Sir G. G. Stokes;
and the results gained more ready interpretation by the introduction
of &ldquo;Babinet&rsquo;s principle&rdquo; in 1837, and Cornu&rsquo;s graphic
methods in 1874. The theory also gained by the researches
of Fraunhofer, Airy, Schwerd, E. Lommel and others. The
theory of the concave grating, which resulted from H. A. Rowland&rsquo;s
classical methods of ruling lines of the necessary nature
and number on curved surfaces, was worked out by Rowland,
E. Mascart, C. Runge and others. The resolving power and the
intensity of the spectra have been treated by Lord Rayleigh
and Arthur Schuster, and more recently (1905), the distribution
of light has been treated by A. B. Porter. The theory of diffraction
is of great importance in designing optical instruments,
the theory of which has been more especially treated by Ernst
Abbe (whose theory of microscopic vision dates from about
1870) by the scientific staff at the Zeiss works, Jena, by Rayleigh
and others. The theory of coronae (as diffraction phenomena)
was originally due to Young, who, from the principle involved,
devised the <i>eriometer</i> for measuring the diameters of very small
objects; and Sir G. G. Stokes subsequently explained the
appearances presented by minute opaque particles borne on a
transparent plate. The polarization of the light diffracted at a
slit was noted in 1861 by Fizeau, whose researches were extended
in 1892 by H. Du Bois, and, for the case of gratings, by Du Bois
and Rubens in 1904. The diffraction of light by small particles
was studied in the form of very fine chemical precipitates by
John Tyndall, who noticed the polarization of the beautiful
cerulean blue which was transmitted. This subject&mdash;one form
of which is presented in the blue colour of the sky&mdash;has been
most auspiciously treated by Lord Rayleigh on both the elastic-solid
and electromagnetic theories. Mention may be made of
R. W. Wood&rsquo;s experiments on thin metal films which, under
certain conditions, originate colour phenomena inexplicable by
interference and diffraction. These colours have been assigned
to the principle of optical resonance, and have been treated by
Kossonogov (<i>Phys. Zeit.</i>, 1903). J. C. Maxwell Garnett (<i>Phil.
Trans</i>. vol. 203) has shown that the colours of coloured glasses
are due to ultra-microscopic particles, which have been directly
studied by H. Siedentopf and R. Zsigmondy under limiting
oblique illumination.</p>

<p>Polarization phenomena may, with great justification, be
regarded as the most engrossing subject of optical research
during the 19th century; the assiduity with which it was
cultivated in the opening decades of that century received
a great stimulus when James Nicol devised in 1828 the famous
&ldquo;Nicol prism,&rdquo; which greatly facilitated the determination of
the plane of vibration of polarized light, and the facts that
light is polarized by reflection, repeated refractions, double
refraction and by diffraction also contributed to the interest
which the subject excited. The rotation of the plane of polarization
by quartz was discovered in 1811 by Arago; if white light
be used the colours change as the Nicol rotates&mdash;a phenomenon
termed by Biot &ldquo;rotatory dispersion.&rdquo; Fresnel regarded
rotatory polarization as compounded from right- and left-handed
(dextro- and laevo-) circular polarizations; and Fresnel,
Cornu, Dove and Cotton effected their experimental separation.
Legrand des Cloizeaux discovered the enormously enhanced
rotatory polarization of cinnabar, a property also possessed&mdash;but
in a lesser degree&mdash;by the sulphates of strychnine and
ethylene diamine. The rotatory power of certain liquids was
discovered by Biot in 1815; and at a later date it was found
that many solutions behaved similarly. A. Schuster distinguishes
substances with regard to their action on polarized
light as follows: substances which act in the isotropic state
are termed <i>photogyric</i>; if the rotation be associated with crystal
structure, <i>crystallogyric</i>; if the rotation be due to a magnetic
field, <i>magnetogyric</i>; for cases not hitherto included the term
<i>allogyric</i> is employed, while optically inactive substances are
called <i>isogyric</i>. The theory of photogyric and crystallogyric
rotation has been worked out on the elastic-solid (MacCullagh
and others) and on the electromagnetic hypotheses (P. Drude,
Cotton, &amp;c.). Allogyrism is due to a symmetry of the molecule,
and is a subject of the greatest importance in modern (and,
more especially, organic) chemistry (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Stereoisomerism</a></span>).</p>

<p>The optical properties of metals have been the subject of
much experimental and theoretical inquiry. The explanations
of MacCullagh and Cauchy were followed by those of Beer,
Eisenlohr, Lundquist, Ketteler and others; the refractive
indices were determined both directly (by Kundt) and indirectly
by means of Brewster&rsquo;s law; and the reflecting powers from
&lambda; = 251 µµ to &lambda; = 1500 µµ were determined in 1900-1902 by
Rubens and Hagen. The correlation of the optical and electrical
constants of many metals has been especially studied by P. Drude
(1900) and by Rubens and Hagen (1903).</p>

<p>The transformations of luminous radiations have also been
studied. John Tyndall discovered calorescence. Fluorescence
was treated by John Herschel in 1845, and by David Brewster
in 1846, the theory being due to Sir G. G. Stokes (1852). More
recent studies have been made by Lommel, E. L. Nichols and
Merritt (<i>Phys. Rev.</i>, 1904), and by Millikan who discovered
polarized fluorescence in 1895. Our knowledge of phosphorescence
was greatly improved by Becquerel, and Sir James
Dewar obtained interesting results in the course of his low
temperature researches (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Liquid Gases</a></span>). In the theoretical
and experimental study of radiation enormous progress has been
recorded. The pressure of radiation, the necessity of which
was demonstrated by Clerk Maxwell on the electromagnetic
theory, and, in a simpler manner, by Joseph Larmor in his
article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Radiation</a></span> in these volumes, has been experimentally
determined by E. F. Nichols and Hull, and the tangential
component by J. H. Poynting. With the theoretical and
practical investigation the names of Balfour Stewart, Kirchhoff,
Stefan, Bartoli, Boltzmann, W. Wien and Larmor are chiefly
associated. Magneto-optics, too, has been greatly developed
since Faraday&rsquo;s discovery of the rotation of the plane of polarization
by the magnetic field. The rotation for many substances
was measured by Sir William H. Perkin, who attempted a
correlation between rotation and composition. Brace effected
the analysis of the beam into its two circularly polarized
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page617" id="page617"></a>617</span>
components, and in 1904 Mills measured their velocities. The
Kerr effect, discovered in 1877, and the Zeeman effect (1896)
widened the field of research, which, from its intimate connexion
with the nature of light and electromagnetics, has resulted
in discoveries of the greatest importance.</p>

<p>§ 14. <i>Optical Instruments.</i>&mdash;Important developments have
been made in the construction and applications of optical
instruments. To these three factors have contributed. The
mathematician has quantitatively analysed the phenomena
observed by the physicist, and has inductively shown what
results are to be expected from certain optical systems. A
consequence of this was the detailed study, and also the preparation,
of glasses of diverse properties; to this the chemist largely
contributed, and the manufacture of the so-called <i>optical glass</i>
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Glass</a></span>) is possibly the most scientific department of glass
manufacture. The mathematical investigations of lenses owe
much to Gauss, Helmholtz and others, but far more to Abbe,
who introduced the method of studying the aberrations separately,
and applied his results with conspicuous skill to the
construction of optical systems. The development of Abbe&rsquo;s
methods constitutes the main subject of research of the present-day
optician, and has brought about the production of telescopes,
microscopes, photographic lenses and other optical
apparatus to an unprecedented pitch of excellence. Great
improvements have been effected in the stereoscope. Binocular
instruments with enhanced stereoscopic vision, an effect achieved
by increasing the distance between the object glasses, have been
introduced. In the study of diffraction phenomena, which led
to the technical preparation of gratings, the early attempts
of Fraunhofer, Nobert and Lewis Morris Rutherfurd, were
followed by H. A. Rowland&rsquo;s ruling of plane and concave gratings
which revolutionized spectroscopic research, and, in 1898, by
Michelson&rsquo;s invention of the echelon grating. Of great importance
are interferometers, which permit extremely accurate
determinations of refractive indices and wave-lengths, and
Michelson, from his classical evaluation of the standard metre
in terms of the wave-lengths of certain of the cadmium rays,
has suggested the adoption of the wave-length of one such
ray as a standard with which national standards of length
should be compared. Polarization phenomena, and particularly
the rotation of the plane of polarization by such substances as
sugar solutions, have led to the invention and improvements
of polarimeters. The polarized light employed in such instruments
is invariably obtained by transmission through a fixed
Nicol prism&mdash;the polarizer&mdash;and the deviation is measured
by the rotation of a second Nicol&mdash;the analyser. The early
forms, which were termed &ldquo;light and shade&rdquo; polarimeters,
have been generally replaced by &ldquo;half-shade&rdquo; instruments.
Mention may also be made of the microscopic examination
of objects in polarized light, the importance of which as a
method of crystallographic and petrological research was
suggested by Nicol, developed by Sorby and greatly expanded
by Zirkel, Rosenbusch and others.</p>

<p class="pt2 center">II. <span class="sc">Nature of Light</span></p>

<p>1. <i>Newton&rsquo;s Corpuscular Theory.</i>&mdash;Until the beginning of the
19th century physicists were divided between two different
views concerning the nature of optical phenomena. According
to the one, luminous bodies emit extremely small corpuscles
which can freely pass through transparent substances and
produce the sensation of light by their impact against the retina.
This <i>emission</i> or <i>corpuscular theory</i> of light was supported by
the authority of Isaac Newton,<a name="fa8n" id="fa8n" href="#ft8n"><span class="sp">8</span></a> and, though it has been entirely
superseded by its rival, the <i>wave-theory</i>, it remains of considerable
historical interest.</p>

<p>2. <i>Explanation of Reflection and Refraction.</i>&mdash;Newton supposed
the light-corpuscles to be subjected to attractive and repulsive
forces exerted at very small distances by the particles of matter.
In the interior of a homogeneous body a corpuscle moves in a
straight line as it is equally acted on from all sides, but it changes
its course at the boundary of two bodies, because, in a thin layer
near the surface there is a resultant force in the direction of
the normal. In modern language we may say that a corpuscle
has at every point a definite potential energy, the value of which
is constant throughout the interior of a homogeneous body, and
is even equal in all bodies of the same kind, but changes from
one substance to another. If, originally, while moving in air,
the corpuscles had a definite velocity v<span class="su">0</span>, their velocity v in the
interior of any other substance is quite determinate. It is given
by the equation ½mv<span class="sp">2</span> &minus; ½mv<span class="su">0</span><span class="sp">2</span> = A, in which m denotes the mass
of a corpuscle, and A the excess of its potential energy in air
over that in the substance considered.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>A ray of light falling on the surface of separation of two bodies
is reflected according to the well-known simple law, if the corpuscles
are acted on by a sufficiently large force directed towards the first
medium. On the contrary, whenever the field of force near the
surface is such that the corpuscles can penetrate into the interior
of the second body, the ray is refracted. In this case the law of
Snellius can be deduced from the consideration that the projection
w of the velocity on the surface of separation is not altered, either
in direction or in magnitude. This obviously requires that the
plane passing through the incident and the refracted rays be normal
to the surface, and that, if &alpha;<span class="su">1</span> and &alpha;<span class="su">2</span> are the angles of incidence and
of refraction, v<span class="su">1</span> and v<span class="su">2</span> the velocities of light in the two media,</p>

<p class="center">sin &alpha;<span class="su">1</span>/sin &alpha;<span class="su">2</span> = w/v<span class="su">1</span> : w/v<span class="su">2</span> = v<span class="su">2</span>/v<span class="su">1</span>.</p>
<div class="author">(1)</div>

<p class="noind">The ratio is constant, because, as has already been observed, v<span class="su">1</span> and
v<span class="su">2</span> have definite values.</p>

<p>As to the unequal refrangibility of differently coloured light,
Newton accounted for it by imagining different kinds of corpuscles.
He further carefully examined the phenomenon of total reflection,
and described an interesting experiment connected with it. If one
of the faces of a glass prism receives on the inside a beam of light of
such obliquity that it is totally reflected under ordinary circumstances,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page618" id="page618"></a>618</span>
a marked change is observed when a second piece of glass is made
to approach the reflecting face, so as to be separated from it only
by a very thin layer of air. The reflection is then found no longer
to be total, part of the light finding its way into the second piece of
glass. Newton concluded from this that the corpuscles are attracted
by the glass even at a certain small measurable distance.</p>
</div>

<p>3. <i>New Hypotheses in the Corpuscular Theory.</i>&mdash;The preceding
explanation of reflection and refraction is open to a very serious
objection. If the particles in a beam of light all moved with
the same velocity and were acted on by the same forces, they
all ought to follow exactly the same path. In order to understand
that part of the incident light is reflected and part of it transmitted,
Newton imagined that each corpuscle undergoes certain
alternating changes; he assumed that in some of its different
&ldquo;phases&rdquo; it is more apt to be reflected, and in others more
apt to be transmitted. The same idea was applied by him to
the phenomena presented by very thin layers. He had observed
that a gradual increase of the thickness of a layer produces
periodic changes in the intensity of the reflected light, and he
very ingeniously explained these by his theory. It is clear that
the intensity of the transmitted light will be a minimum if the
corpuscles that have traversed the front surface of the layer,
having reached that surface while in their phase of easy transmission,
have passed to the opposite phase the moment they
arrive at the back surface. As to the nature of the alternating
phases, Newton (<i>Opticks</i>, 3rd ed., 1721, p. 347) expresses himself
as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Nothing more is requisite for putting the Rays
of Light into Fits of easy Reflexion and easy Transmission than
that they be small Bodies which by their attractive Powers, or
some other Force, stir up Vibrations in what they act upon,
which Vibrations being swifter than the Rays, overtake them
successively, and agitate them so as by turns to increase and
decrease their Velocities, and thereby put them into those Fits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>4. <i>The Corpuscular Theory and the Wave-Theory compared.</i>&mdash;Though
Newton introduced the notion of periodic changes,
which was to play so prominent a part in the later development
of the wave-theory, he rejected this theory in the form in which
it had been set forth shortly before by Christiaan Huygens in
his <i>Traité de la lumière</i> (1690), his chief objections being: (1) that
the rectilinear propagation had not been satisfactorily accounted
for; (2) that the motions of heavenly bodies show no sign of a
resistance due to a medium filling all space; and (3) that Huygens
had not sufficiently explained the peculiar properties of the
rays produced by the double refraction in Iceland spar. In
Newton&rsquo;s days these objections were of much weight.</p>

<p>Yet his own theory had many weaknesses. It explained the
propagation in straight lines, but it could assign no cause for
the equality of the speed of propagation of all rays. It adapted
itself to a large variety of phenomena, even to that of double
refraction (Newton says [<i>ibid.</i>]:&mdash;&ldquo;... the unusual Refraction
of Iceland Crystal looks very much as if it were perform&rsquo;d by
some kind of attractive virtue lodged in certain Sides both of
the Rays, and of the Particles of the Crystal.&rdquo;), but it could
do so only at the price of losing much of its original simplicity.</p>

<p>In the earlier part of the 19th century, the corpuscular theory
broke down under the weight of experimental evidence, and it
received the final blow when J. B. L. Foucault proved by direct
experiment that the velocity of light in water is not greater than
that in air, as it should be according to the formula (1), but less
than it, as is required by the wave-theory.</p>

<p>5. <i>General Theorems on Rays of Light.</i>&mdash;With the aid of
suitable assumptions the Newtonian theory can accurately
trace the course of a ray of light in any system of isotropic
bodies, whether homogeneous or otherwise; the problem being
equivalent to that of determining the motion of a material
point in a space in which its potential energy is given as a function
of the coordinates. The application of the dynamical principles
of &ldquo;least and of varying action&rdquo; to this latter problem leads
to the following important theorems which William Rowan
Hamilton made the basis of his exhaustive treatment of systems
of rays.<a name="fa9n" id="fa9n" href="#ft9n"><span class="sp">9</span></a> The total energy of a corpuscle is supposed to have
a given value, so that, since the potential energy is considered
as known at every point, the velocity v is so likewise.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>(<i>a</i>) The path along which light travels from a point A to a point B
is determined by the condition that for this line the integral &int;v ds,
in which ds is an element of the line, be a minimum (provided A and
B be not too near each other). Therefore, since v = µv<span class="su">0</span>, if v<span class="su">0</span> is the
velocity of light <i>in vacuo</i> and µ the index of refraction, we have for
every variation of the path the points A and B remaining fixed,</p>

<p class="center">&delta;&int;µ ds = 0.</p>
<div class="author">(2)</div>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Let the point A be kept fixed, but let B undergo an infinitely
small displacement BB&prime; (= q) in a direction making an angle &theta; with
the last element of the ray AB. Then, comparing the new ray AB&prime;
with the original one, it follows that</p>

<p class="center">&delta;&int;µ ds = µ<span class="su">&Beta;</span>q cos &theta;,</p>
<div class="author">(3)</div>

<p class="noind">where µ<span class="su">&Beta;</span> is the value of µ at the point B.</p>
</div>

<p>6. <i>General Considerations on the Propagation of Waves.</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Waves,&rdquo;
<i>i.e.</i> local disturbances of equilibrium travelling
onward with a certain speed, can exist in a large variety of
systems. In a theory of these phenomena, the state of things
at a definite point may in general be defined by a certain directed
or vector quantity <b>P</b>,<a name="fa10n" id="fa10n" href="#ft10n"><span class="sp">10</span></a> which is zero in the state of equilibrium,
and may be called the disturbance (for example, the velocity
of the air in the case of sound vibrations, or the displacement
of the particles of an elastic body from their positions of equilibrium).
The components <b>P</b><span class="su">x</span>, <b>P</b><span class="su">y</span>, <b>P</b><span class="su">z</span> of the disturbance in the
directions of the axes of coordinates are to be considered as
functions of the coordinates x, y, z and the time t, determined
by a set of partial differential equations, whose form depends
on the nature of the problem considered. If the equations are
homogeneous and linear, as they always are for sufficiently
small disturbances, the following theorems hold.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>(<i>a</i>) Values of <b>P</b><span class="su">x</span>, <b>P</b><span class="su">y</span>, <b>P</b><span class="su">z</span> (expressed in terms of x, y, z, t) which
satisfy the equations will do so still after multiplication by a common
arbitrary constant.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Two or more solutions of the equations may be combined into
a new solution by addition of the values of <b>P</b><span class="su">x</span>, those of <b>P</b><span class="su">y</span>, &amp;c., <i>i.e.</i>
by compounding the vectors <b>P</b>, such as they are in each of the
particular solutions.</p>

<p>In the application to light, the first proposition means that the
phenomena of propagation, reflection, refraction, &amp;c., can be produced
in the same way with strong as with weak light. The second
proposition contains the principle of the &ldquo;superposition&rdquo; of different
states, on which the explanation of all phenomena of interference
is made to depend.</p>

<p>In the simplest cases (monochromatic or homogeneous light) the
disturbance is a simple harmonic function of the time (&ldquo;simple
harmonic vibrations&rdquo;), so that its components can be represented by</p>

<p class="center"><b>P</b><span class="su">x</span> = a<span class="su">1</span> cos (nt + &fnof;<span class="su">1</span>), <b>P</b><span class="su">y</span> = a<span class="su">2</span> cos (nt + &fnof;<span class="su">2</span>), <b>P</b><span class="su">z</span> = a<span class="su">3</span> cos (nt + &fnof;<span class="su">3</span>).</p>

<p>The &ldquo;phases&rdquo; of these vibrations are determined by the angles
nt + &fnof;<span class="su">1</span>, &amp;c., or by the times t + &fnof;<span class="su">1</span>/n, &amp;c. The &ldquo;frequency&rdquo; n is constant
throughout the system, while the quantities &fnof;<span class="su">1</span>, &fnof;<span class="su">2</span>, &fnof;<span class="su">3</span>, and
perhaps the &ldquo;amplitudes&rdquo; a<span class="su">1</span>, a<span class="su">2</span>, a<span class="su">3</span> change from point to point.
It may be shown that the end of a straight line representing the
vector <b>P</b>, and drawn from the point considered, in general describes
a certain ellipse, which becomes a straight line, if &fnof;<span class="su">1</span> = &fnof;<span class="su">2</span> = &fnof;<span class="su">3</span>. In this
latter case, to which the larger part of this article will be confined,
we can write in vector notation</p>

<p class="center"><b>P</b> = <b>A</b> cos (nt + &fnof;),</p>
<div class="author">(4)</div>

<p class="noind">where <b>A</b> itself is to be regarded as a vector.</p>

<p>We have next to consider the way in which the disturbance
changes from point to point. The most important case is that of
plane waves with constant amplitude <b>A</b>. Here f is the same at all
points of a plane (&ldquo;wave-front&rdquo;) of a definite direction, but changes
as a linear function as we pass from one such wave-front to the next.
The axis of x being drawn at right angles to the wave-fronts, we may
write &fnof; = &fnof;<span class="su">0</span> &minus; kx, where &fnof;<span class="su">0</span> and k are constants, so that (4) becomes</p>

<p class="center">P = A cos (nt &minus; kx + &fnof;<span class="su">0</span>).</p>
<div class="author">(5)</div>

<p class="noind">This expression has the period 2&pi;/n with respect to the time
and the perion 2&pi;/k with respect to x, so that the &ldquo;time of
vibration&rdquo; and the &ldquo;wave-length&rdquo; are given by T = 2&pi;/n, &lambda; = 2&pi;/k.
Further, it is easily seen that the phase belonging to certain values
of x and t is equal to that which corresponds to x + &Delta;x and t + &Delta;t
provided &Delta;x = (n/k) &Delta;t. Therefore the phase, or the disturbance
itself, may be said to be propagated in the direction normal to the
wave-fronts with a velocity (velocity of the waves) v = n/k, which
is connected with the time of vibration and the wave-length by the
relation</p>

<p class="center">&lambda; = vT.</p>
<div class="author">(6)</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page619" id="page619"></a>619</span></p>

<p class="noind">In isotropic bodies the propagation can go on in all directions with
the same velocity. In anisotropic bodies (crystals), with which the
theory of light is largely concerned, the problem is more complicated.
As a general rule we can say that, for a given direction of the wave-fronts,
the vibrations must have a determinate direction, if the
propagation is to take place according to the simple formula given
above. It is to be understood that for a given direction of the waves
there may be two or even more directions of vibration of the kind,
and that in such a case there are as many different velocities, each
belonging to one particular direction of vibration.</p>
</div>

<p>7. <i>Wave-surface.</i>&mdash;After having found the values of v for
a particular frequency and different directions of the wave-normal,
a very instructive graphical representation can be
employed.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Let ON be a line in any direction, drawn from a fixed point O, OA
a length along this line equal to the velocity v of waves having ON
for their normal, or, more generally, OA, OA&prime;, &amp;c., lengths equal to the
velocities v, v&prime;, &amp;c., which such waves have according to their direction
of vibration, Q, Q&prime;, &amp;c., planes perpendicular to ON through A, A<span class="sp">1</span>, &amp;c.
Let this construction be repeated for all directions of ON, and let W
be the surface that is touched by all the planes Q, Q&prime;, &amp;c. It is clear
that if this surface, which is called the &ldquo;wave-surface,&rdquo; is known,
the velocity of propagation of plane waves of any chosen direction is
given by the length of the perpendicular from the centre O on a
tangent plane in the given direction. It must be kept in mind that,
in general, each tangent plane corresponds to one definite direction
of vibration. If this direction is assigned in each point of the wave-surface,
the diagram contains all the information which we can desire
concerning the propagation of plane waves of the frequency that has
been chosen.</p>

<p>The plane Q employed in the above construction is the position
after unit of time of a wave-front perpendicular to ON and originally
passing through the point O. The surface W itself is often considered
as the locus of all points that are reached in unit of time by a disturbance
starting from O and spreading towards all sides. Admitting
the validity of this view, we can determine in a similar way the locus
of the points reached in some infinitely short time dt, the wave-surface,
as we may say, or the &ldquo;elementary wave,&rdquo; corresponding
to this time. It is similar to W, all dimensions of the latter surface
being multiplied by dt. It may be noticed that in a heterogeneous
medium a wave of this kind has the same form as if the properties
of matter existing at its centre extended over a finite space.</p>
</div>

<p>8. <i>Theory of Huygens.</i>&mdash;Huygens was the first to show that
the explanation of optical phenomena may be made to depend
on the wave-surface, not only in isotropic bodies, in which it
has a spherical form, but also in crystals, for one of which
(Iceland spar) he deduced the form of the surface from the
observed double refraction. In his argument Huygens availed
himself of the following principle that is justly named after
him: Any point that is reached by a wave of light becomes
a new centre of radiation from which the disturbance is propagated
towards all sides. On this basis he determined the progress
of light-waves by a construction which, under a restriction to be
mentioned in § 13, applied to waves of any form and to all kinds
of transparent media. Let &sigma; be the surface (wave-front) to
which a definite phase of vibration has advanced at a certain
time t, dt an infinitely small increment of time, and let an
elementary wave corresponding to this interval be described
around each point P of &sigma;. Then the envelope &sigma;&prime; of all these
elementary waves is the surface reached by the phase in question
at the time t + dt, and by repeating the construction all successive
positions of the wave-front can be found.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Huygens also considered the propagation of waves that are
laterally limited, by having passed, for example, through an opening
in an opaque screen. If, in the first wave-front &sigma;, the disturbance
exists only in a certain part bounded by the contour s, we can confine
ourselves to the elementary waves around the points of that part,
and to a portion of the new wave-front &sigma;&prime; whose boundary passes
through the points where &sigma;&prime; touches the elementary waves having
their centres on s. Taking for granted Huygens&rsquo;s assumption that
a sensible disturbance is only found in those places where the elementary
waves are touched by the new wave-front, it may be inferred
that the lateral limits of the beam of light are determined by lines,
each element of which joins the centre P of an elementary wave with
its point of contact P&prime; with the next wave-front. To lines of this kind,
whose course can be made visible by using narrow pencils of light, the
name of &ldquo;rays&rdquo; is to be given in the wave-theory. The disturbance
may be conceived to travel along them with a velocity u = PP&prime;/dt,
which is therefore called the &ldquo;ray-velocity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The construction shows that, corresponding to each direction of
the wave-front (with a determinate direction of vibration), there is
a definite direction and a definite velocity of the ray. Both are given
by a line drawn from the centre of the wave-surface to its point of
contact with a tangent plane of the given direction. It will be convenient
to say that this line and the plane are conjugate with each
other. The rays of light, curved in non-homogeneous bodies, are
always straight lines in homogeneous substances. In an isotropic
medium, whether homogeneous or otherwise, they are normal to
the wave-fronts, and their velocity is equal to that of the waves.</p>

<p>By applying his construction to the reflection and refraction of
light, Huygens accounted for these phenomena in isotropic bodies
as well as in Iceland spar. It was afterwards shown by Augustin
Fresnel that the double refraction in biaxal crystals can be explained
in the same way, provided the proper form be assigned to the
wave-surface.</p>

<p>In any point of a bounding surface the normals to the reflected
and refracted waves, whatever be their number, always lie in the
plane passing through the normal to the incident waves and that to
the surface itself. Moreover, if &alpha;<span class="su">1</span> is the angle between these two
latter normals, and &alpha;<span class="su">2</span> the angle between the normal to the boundary
and that to any one of the reflected and refracted waves, and v<span class="su">1</span>, v<span class="su">2</span> the
corresponding wave-velocities, the relation</p>

<p class="center">sin &alpha;<span class="su">1</span>/sin &alpha;<span class="su">2</span> = v<span class="su">1</span>/v<span class="su">2</span></p>
<div class="author">(7)</div>

<p class="noind">is found to hold in all cases. These important theorems may be
proved independently of Huygens&rsquo;s construction by simply observing
that, at each point of the surface of separation, there must be a
certain connexion between the disturbances existing in the incident,
the reflected, and the refracted waves, and that, therefore, the lines
of intersection of the surface with the positions of an incident wave-front,
succeeding each other at equal intervals of time dt, must
coincide with the lines in which the surface is intersected by a similar
series of reflected or refracted wave-fronts.</p>

<p>In the case of isotropic media, the ratio (7) is constant, so that
we are led to the law of Snellius, the index of refraction being given by</p>

<p class="center">µ = v<span class="su">1</span>/v<span class="su">2</span>  (8)</p>
<div class="author">(8)</div>

<p class="noind">(cf. equation 1).</p>

<p>9. <i>General Theorems on Rays, deduced from Huygens&rsquo;s Construction.</i>&mdash;(<i>a</i>)
Let A and B be two points arbitrarily chosen in a system of
transparent bodies, ds an element of a line drawn from A to B, u the
velocity of a ray of light coinciding with ds. Then the integral
&int;u<span class="sp">&minus;1</span> ds, which represents the time required for a motion along the
line with the velocity u, is a minimum for the course actually taken
by a ray of light (unless A and B be too far apart). This is the
&ldquo;principle of least time&rdquo; first formulated by Pierre de Fermat for
the case of two isotropic substances. It shows that the course of a
ray of light can always be inverted.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Rays of light starting in all directions from a point A and travelling
onward for a definite length of time, reach a surface &sigma;, whose
tangent plane at a point B is conjugate, in the medium surrounding
B, with the last element of the ray AB.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) If all rays issuing from A are concentrated at a point B, the
integral &int;u<span class="sp">-1</span>ds has the same value for each of them.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) In case (<i>b</i>) the variation of the integral caused by an infinitely
small displacement q of B, the point A remaining fixed, is given by
&delta;&int;u<span class="sp">&minus;1</span> ds = q cos &theta;/v<span class="su">B</span>. Here &theta; is the angle between the displacement
q and the normal to the surface &sigma;, in the direction of propagation,
v<span class="su">B</span> the velocity of a plane wave tangent to this surface.</p>

<p>In the case of isotropic bodies, for which the relation (8) holds,
we recover the theorems concerning the integral &int;µds which we have
deduced from the emission theory (§ 5).</p>

<p>10. <i>Further General Theorems.</i>&mdash;(<i>a</i>) Let V<span class="su">1</span> and V<span class="su">2</span> be two planes
in a system of isotropic bodies, let rectangular axes of coordinates
be chosen in each of these planes, and let x<span class="su">1</span>, y<span class="su">1</span> be the coordinates of a
point A in V<span class="su">1</span>, and x<span class="su">2</span>, y<span class="su">2</span> those of a point B in V<span class="su">2</span>. The integral &int;µds,
taken for the ray between A and B, is a function of x<span class="su">1</span>, y<span class="su">1</span>, x<span class="su">2</span>, y<span class="su">2</span> and,
if &xi;<span class="su">1</span> denotes either x<span class="su">1</span> or y<span class="su">1</span>, and &xi;<span class="su">2</span> either x<span class="su">2</span> or y<span class="su">2</span>, we shall have</p>

<p class="noind">On both sides of this equation the first differentiation may be performed
by means of the formula (3). The second differentiation
admits of a geometrical interpretation, and the formula may finally
be employed for proving the following theorem:</p>

<p>Let &omega;<span class="su">1</span> be the solid angle of an infinitely thin pencil of rays issuing
from A and intersecting the plane V<span class="su">2</span> in an element &sigma;<span class="su">2</span> at the point B.
Similarly, let &omega;<span class="su">2</span> be the solid angle of a pencil starting from B and
falling on the element &sigma;<span class="su">1</span> of the plane V<span class="su">1</span> at the point A. Then,
denoting by µ<span class="su">1</span> and µ<span class="su">2</span> the indices of refraction of the matter at the
points A and B, by &theta;<span class="su">1</span> and &theta;<span class="su">2</span> the sharp angles which the ray AB at its
extremities makes with the normals to V<span class="su">1</span> and V<span class="su">2</span>, we have</p>

<p class="center">µ<span class="su">1</span><span class="sp">2</span> &sigma;<span class="su">1</span> &omega;<span class="su">1</span> cos &theta;<span class="su">1</span> =
 µ<span class="su">2</span><span class="sp">2</span> &sigma;<span class="su">2</span> &omega;<span class="su">2</span> cos &theta;<span class="su">2</span>.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) There is a second theorem that is expressed by exactly the same
formula, if we understand by &sigma;<span class="su">1</span> and &sigma;<span class="su">2</span> elements of surface that are
related to each other as an object and its optical image&mdash;by &omega;<span class="su">1</span>, &omega;<span class="su">2</span>
the infinitely small openings, at the beginning and the end of its
course, of a pencil of rays issuing from a point A of &sigma;<span class="su">1</span> and coming
together at the corresponding point B of &sigma;<span class="su">2</span>, and by &theta;<span class="su">1</span>, &theta;<span class="su">2</span> the sharp
angles which one of the rays makes with the normals to &sigma;<span class="su">1</span> and &sigma;<span class="su">2</span>.
The proof may be based upon the first theorem. It suffices to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page620" id="page620"></a>620</span>
consider the section &sigma; of the pencil by some intermediate plane, and
a bundle of rays starting from the points of &sigma;<span class="su">1</span> and reaching those
of &sigma;<span class="su">2</span> after having all passed through a point of that section &sigma;.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) If in the last theorem the system of bodies is symmetrical
around the straight line AB, we can take for &sigma;<span class="su">1</span> and &sigma;<span class="su">2</span> circular planes
having AB as axis. Let h<span class="su">1</span> and h<span class="su">2</span> be the radii of these circles, <i>i.e.</i>
the linear dimensions of an object and its image, &epsilon;<span class="su">1</span> and &epsilon;<span class="su">2</span> the infinitely
small angles which a ray R going from A to B makes with
the axis at these points. Then the above formula gives
µ<span class="su">1</span>h<span class="su">1</span>&epsilon;<span class="su">1</span> = µ<span class="su">2</span>h<span class="su">2</span>&epsilon;<span class="su">2</span>,
a relation that was proved, for the particular case µ<span class="su">1</span> = µ<span class="su">2</span> by Huygens
and Lagrange. It is still more valuable if one distinguishes by the
algebraic sign of h<span class="su">2</span> whether the image is direct or inverted, and by
that of &epsilon;<span class="su">2</span> whether the ray R on leaving A and on reaching B lies
on opposite sides of the axis or on the same side.</p>

<p>The above theorems are of much service in the theory of optical
instruments and in the general theory of radiation.</p>
</div>

<p>11. <i>Phenomena of Interference and Diffraction.</i>&mdash;The impulses
or motions which a luminous body sends forth through the
universal medium or aether, were considered by Huygens as
being without any regular succession; he neither speaks of
vibrations, nor of the physical cause of the colours. The idea
that monochromatic light consists of a succession of simple
harmonic vibrations like those represented by the equation (5),
and that the sensation of colour depends on the frequency,
is due to Thomas Young<a name="fa11n" id="fa11n" href="#ft11n"><span class="sp">11</span></a> and Fresnel,<a name="fa12n" id="fa12n" href="#ft12n"><span class="sp">12</span></a> who explained the
phenomena of interference on this assumption combined with
the principle of super-position. In doing so they were also
enabled to determine the wave-length, ranging from 0.000076
cm. at the red end of the spectrum to 0.000039 cm. for the
extreme violet and, by means of the formula (6), the number
of vibrations per second. Later investigations have shown
that the infra-red rays as well as the ultra-violet ones are of
the same physical nature as the luminous rays, differing from
these only by the greater or smaller length of their waves. The
wave-length amounts to 0.006 cm. for the least refrangible
infra-red, and is as small as 0.00001 cm. for the extreme
ultra-violet.</p>

<p>Another important part of Fresnel&rsquo;s work is his treatment of
diffraction on the basis of Huygens&rsquo;s principle. If, for example,
light falls on a screen with a narrow slit, each point of the slit
is regarded as a new centre of vibration, and the intensity at
any point behind the screen is found by compounding with each
other the disturbances coming from all these points, due account
being taken of the phases with which they come together (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Diffraction</a></span>; <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Interference</a></span>).</p>

<p>12. <i>Results of Later Mathematical Theory.</i>&mdash;Though the theory
of diffraction developed by Fresnel, and by other physicists
who worked on the same lines, shows a most beautiful agreement
with observed facts, yet its foundation, Huygens&rsquo;s principle,
cannot, in its original elementary form, be deemed quite satisfactory.
The general validity of the results has, however, been
confirmed by the researches of those mathematicians (Siméon
Denis Poisson, Augustin Louis Cauchy, Sir G. G. Stokes, Gustav
Robert Kirchhoff) who investigated the propagation of vibrations
in a more rigorous manner. Kirchhoff<a name="fa13n" id="fa13n" href="#ft13n"><span class="sp">13</span></a> showed that the disturbance
at any point of the aether inside a closed surface which
contains no ponderable matter can be represented as made up
of a large number of parts, each of which depends upon the state
of things at one point of the surface. This result, the modern
form of Huygens&rsquo;s principle, can be extended to a system of
bodies of any kind, the only restriction being that the source
of light be not surrounded by the surface. Certain causes
capable of producing vibrations can be imagined to be distributed
all over this latter, in such a way that the disturbances to which
they give rise in the enclosed space are exactly those which are
brought about by the real source of light.<a name="fa14n" id="fa14n" href="#ft14n"><span class="sp">14</span></a> Another interesting
result that has been verified by experiment is that, whenever
rays of light pass through a focus, the phase undergoes a change
of half a period. It must be added that the results alluded to in
the above, though generally presented in the terms of some
particular form of the wave theory, often apply to other forms
as well.</p>

<p>13. <i>Rays of Light.</i>&mdash;In working out the theory of diffraction
it is possible to state exactly in what sense light may be said to
travel in straight lines. Behind an opening <i>whose width is very
large in comparison with the wave-length</i> the limits between the
illuminated and the dark parts of space are approximately
determined by rays passing along the borders.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>This conclusion can also be arrived at by a mode of reasoning that
is independent of the theory of diffraction.<a name="fa15n" id="fa15n" href="#ft15n"><span class="sp">15</span></a> If linear differential
equations admit a solution of the form (5) with <b>A</b> constant, they can
also be satisfied by making <b>A</b> a function of the coordinates, such
that, in a wave-front, it changes very little over a distance equal
to the wave-length &lambda;, and that it is constant along each line conjugate
with the wave-fronts. In cases of this kind the disturbance may
truly be said to travel along lines of the said direction, and an
observer who is unable to discern lengths of the order of &lambda;, and who
uses an opening of much larger dimensions, may very well have
the impression of a cylindrical beam with a sharp boundary.</p>

<p>A similar result is found for curved waves. If the additional
restriction is made that their radii of curvature be very much
larger than the wave-length, Huygens&rsquo;s construction may confidently
be employed. The amplitudes all along a ray are determined
by, and proportional to, the amplitude at one of its points.</p>
</div>

<p>14. <i>Polarized Light.</i>&mdash;As the theorems used in the explanation
of interference and diffraction are true for all kinds of vibratory
motions, these phenomena can give us no clue to the special
kind of vibrations in light-waves. Further information, however,
may be drawn from experiments on plane polarized light. The
properties of a beam of this kind are completely known when
the position of a certain plane passing through the direction
of the rays, and <i>in</i> which the beam is said to be polarized, is
given. &ldquo;This plane of polarization,&rdquo; as it is called, coincides
with the plane of incidence in those cases where the light has been
polarized by reflection on a glass surface under an angle of
incidence whose tangent is equal to the index of refraction
(Brewster&rsquo;s law).</p>

<p>The researches of Fresnel and Arago left no doubt as to the
direction of the vibrations in polarized light with respect to that
of the rays themselves. In isotropic bodies at least, the vibrations
are exactly transverse, <i>i.e.</i> perpendicular to the rays,
either in the plane of polarization or at right angles to it. The
first part of this statement also applies to unpolarized light, as
this can always be dissolved into polarized components.</p>

<p>Much experimental work has been done on the production
of polarized rays by double refraction and on the reflection of
polarized light, either by isotropic or by anisotropic transparent
bodies, the object of inquiry being in the latter case to determine
the position of the plane of polarization of the reflected rays and
their intensity.</p>

<p>In this way a large amount of evidence has been gathered by
which it has been possible to test different theories concerning
the nature of light and that of the medium through which it
is propagated. A common feature of nearly all these theories
is that the aether is supposed to exist not only in spaces void
of matter, but also in the interior of ponderable bodies.</p>

<p>15. <i>Fresnel&rsquo;s Theory.</i>&mdash;Fresnel and his immediate successors
assimilated the aether to an elastic solid, so that the velocity
of propagation of transverse vibrations could be determined
by the formula v = &radic;(K/&rho;), where K denotes the modulus of
rigidity and &rho; the density. According to this equation the
different properties of various isotropic transparent bodies
may arise from different values of K, of &rho;, or of both. It has,
however, been found that if both K and &rho; are supposed to change
from one substance to another, it is impossible to obtain the
right reflection formulae. Assuming the constancy of K Fresnel
was led to equations which agreed with the observed properties
of the reflected light, if he made the further assumption (to be
mentioned in what follows as &ldquo;Fresnel&rsquo;s assumption&rdquo;) that the
vibrations of plane polarized light are perpendicular to the plane
of polarization.</p>

<p>Let the indices p and n relate to the two principal cases in which
the incident (and, consequently, the reflected) light is polarized in
the plane of incidence, or normally to it, and let positive directions
h and h&prime; be chosen for the disturbance (at the surface itself) in the
incident and for that in the reflected beam, in such a manner that,
by a common rotation, h and the incident ray prolonged may be
made to coincide with h&prime; and the reflected ray. Then, if &alpha;<span class="su">1</span> and &alpha;<span class="su">2</span>

</div>

<p>As to double refraction, Fresnel made it depend on the unequal
elasticity of the aether in different directions. He came to the
conclusion that, for a given direction of the waves, there are two
possible directions of vibration (§ 6), lying in the wave-front,
at right angles to each other, and he determined the form of
the wave-surface, both in uniaxal and in biaxal crystals.</p>

<p>Though objections may be urged against the dynamic part
of Fresnel&rsquo;s theory, he admirably succeeded in adapting it to
the facts.</p>

<p>16. Electromagnetic Theory.&mdash;We here leave the historical
order and pass on to Maxwell&rsquo;s theory of light.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>James Clerk Maxwell, who had set himself the task of mathematically
working out Michael Faraday&rsquo;s views, and who, both by
doing so and by introducing many new ideas of his own, became the
founder of the modern science of electricity,<a name="fa16n" id="fa16n" href="#ft16n"><span class="sp">16</span></a> recognized that, at every
point of an electromagnetic field, the state of things can be defined
by two vector quantities, the &ldquo;electric force&rdquo; <b>E</b> and the &ldquo;magnetic
force&rdquo; <b>H</b>, the former of which is the force acting on unit of electricity
and the latter that which acts on a magnetic pole of unit strength.
In a non-conductor (dielectric) the force <b>E</b> produces a state that
may be described as a displacement of electricity from its position
of equilibrium. This state is represented by a vector <b>D</b> (&ldquo;dielectric
displacement&rdquo;) whose magnitude is measured by the quantity of
electricity reckoned per unit area which has traversed an element
of surface perpendicular to <b>D</b> itself. Similarly, there is a vector
quantity <b>B</b> (the &ldquo;magnetic induction&rdquo;) intimately connected with
the magnetic force <b>H</b>. Changes of the dielectric displacement
constitute an electric current measured by the rate of change of <b>D</b>,
and represented in vector notation by</p>

<p class="noind">For the free aether the velocity has the value c. Now it had been
found that the ratio c between the two units of electricity agrees
within the limits of experimental errors with the numerical value of
the velocity of light in aether. (The mean result of the most exact
determinations<a name="fa17n" id="fa17n" href="#ft17n"><span class="sp">17</span></a> of c is 3,001·10<span class="sp">10</span> cm./sec., the largest deviations

as the most probable value of the velocity of light.) By this Maxwell
was led to suppose that light consists of transverse electromagnetic
disturbances. On this assumption, the equations (16) represent a
beam of plane polarized light. They show that, in such a beam,
there are at the same time electric and magnetic vibrations, both
transverse, and at right angles to each other.</p>

<p>It must be added that the electromagnetic field is the seat of two
kinds of energy distinguished by the names of electric and magnetic
energy, and that, according to a beautiful theorem due to J. H.

<p class="noind">whose mean values for a full period are equal in every beam of light.</p>

<p>The formula (15) shows that the index of refraction of a body is
given by &radic;&epsilon;, a result that has been verified by Ludwig Boltzmann&rsquo;s
measurements<a name="fa20n" id="fa20n" href="#ft20n"><span class="sp">20</span></a> of the dielectric constants of gases. Thus Maxwell&rsquo;s
theory can assign the true cause of the different optical properties
of various transparent bodies. It also leads to the reflection formulae
(9) and (10), provided the electric vibrations of polarized light be
supposed to be perpendicular to the plane of polarization, which
implies that the magnetic vibrations are parallel to that plane.</p>

<p>Following the same assumption Maxwell deduced the laws of double
refraction, which he ascribes to the unequality of &epsilon;<span class="su">1</span>, &epsilon;<span class="su">2</span>, &epsilon;<span class="su">3</span>. His
results agree with those of Fresnel and the theory has been confirmed
by Boltzmann,<a name="fa21n" id="fa21n" href="#ft21n"><span class="sp">21</span></a> who measured the three coefficients in the case of
crystallized sulphur, and compared them with the principal indices
of refraction. Subsequently the problem of crystalline reflection has
been completely solved and it has been shown that, in a crystal,
Poynting&rsquo;s flow of energy has the direction of the rays as determined
by Huygens&rsquo;s construction.</p>

<p>Two further verifications must here be mentioned. In the first
place, though we shall speak almost exclusively of the propagation of
light in transparent dielectrics, a few words may be said about the
optical properties of conductors. The simplest assumption concerning
the electric current <b>C</b> in a metallic body is expressed by the
equation <b>C</b> = &sigma;<b>E</b>, where &sigma; is the coefficient of conductivity. Combining
this with his other formulae (we may say with (12) and (13)),
Maxwell found that there must be an absorption of light, a result
that can be readily understood since the motion of electricity in a
conductor gives rise to a development of heat. But, though Maxwell
accounted in this way for the fundamental fact that metals are
opaque bodies, there remained a wide divergence between the values
of the coefficient of absorption as directly measured and as calculated
from the electrical conductivity; but in 1903 it was shown
by E. Hagen and H. Rubens<a name="fa22n" id="fa22n" href="#ft22n"><span class="sp">22</span></a> that the agreement is very satisfactory
in the case of the extreme infra-red rays.</p>

<p>In the second place, the electromagnetic theory requires that a
surface struck by a beam of light shall experience a certain pressure.
If the beam falls normally on a plane disk, the pressure is normal
too; its total amount is given by c<span class="sp">&minus;1</span>(i<span class="su">1</span> + i<span class="su">2</span> &minus; i<span class="su">3</span>), if i<span class="su">1</span>, i<span class="su">2</span> and  i<span class="su">3</span> are
the quantities of energy that are carried forward per unit of time
by the incident, the reflected, and the transmitted light. This
result has been quantitatively verified by E. F. Nicholls and G. F.
Hull.<a name="fa23n" id="fa23n" href="#ft23n"><span class="sp">23</span></a></p>

<p>Maxwell&rsquo;s predictions have been splendidly confirmed by the
experiments of Heinrich Hertz<a name="fa24n" id="fa24n" href="#ft24n"><span class="sp">24</span></a> and others on electromagnetic
waves; by diminishing the length of these to the utmost, some
physicists have been able to reproduce with them all phenomena of
reflection, refraction (single and double), interference, and polarization.<a name="fa25n" id="fa25n" href="#ft25n"><span class="sp">25</span></a>
A table of the wave-lengths observed in the aether now has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page622" id="page622"></a>622</span>
to contain, besides the numbers given in § 11, the lengths of the
waves produced by electromagnetic apparatus and extending from
the long waves used in wireless telegraphy down to about 0.6 cm.</p>
</div>

<p>17. <i>Mechanical Models of the Electromagnetic Medium.</i>&mdash;From
the results already enumerated, a clear idea can be formed of
the difficulties which were encountered in the older form of
the wave-theory. Whereas, in Maxwell&rsquo;s theory, longitudinal
vibrations are excluded <i>ab initio</i> by the solenoidal distribution
of the electric current, the elastic-solid theory had to take them
into account, unless, as was often done, one made them disappear
by supposing them to have a very great velocity of propagation,
so that the aether was considered to be practically incompressible.
Even on this assumption, however, much in Fresnel&rsquo;s theory
remained questionable. Thus George Green,<a name="fa26n" id="fa26n" href="#ft26n"><span class="sp">26</span></a> who was the first
to apply the theory of elasticity in an unobjectionable manner,
arrived on Fresnel&rsquo;s assumption at a formula for the reflection
coefficient A<span class="su">n</span> sensibly differing from (10).</p>

<p>In the theory of double refraction the difficulties are no less
serious. As a general rule there are in an anisotropic elastic
solid three possible directions of vibration (§ 6), at right angles
to each other, for a given direction of the waves, but none of these
lies in the wave-front. In order to make two of them do so and
to find Fresnel&rsquo;s form for the wave-surface, new hypotheses are
required. On Fresnel&rsquo;s assumption it is even necessary, as was
observed by Green, to suppose that in the absence of all vibrations
there is already a certain state of pressure in the medium.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>If we adhere to Fresnel&rsquo;s assumption, it is indeed scarcely possible
to construct an elastic model of the electromagnetic medium. It
may be done, however, if the velocities of the particles in the model
are taken to represent the magnetic force <b>H</b>, which, of course, implies
that the vibrations of the particles are parallel to the plane of
polarization, and that the magnetic energy is represented by the
kinetic energy in the model. Considering further that, in the case
of two bodies connected with each other, there is continuity of <b>H</b>
in the electromagnetic system, and continuity of the velocity of the
particles in the model, it becomes clear that the representation of
<b>H</b> by that velocity must be on the same scale in all substances, so
that, if &xi;, &eta;, &zeta; are the displacements of a particle and g a universal

<p>18. <i>Theories of Neumann, Green, and MacCullagh.</i>&mdash;A theory
of light in which the elastic aether has a uniform density, and in
which the vibrations are supposed to be parallel to the plane
of polarization, was developed by Franz Ernst Neumann,<a name="fa27n" id="fa27n" href="#ft27n"><span class="sp">27</span></a> who
gave the first deduction of the formulas for crystalline reflection.
Like Fresnel, he was, however, obliged to introduce some
illegitimate assumptions and simplifications. Here again Green
indicated a more rigorous treatment.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>By specializing the formula for the potential energy of an anisotropic
body he arrives at an expression which, if some of his coefficients
are made to vanish and if the medium is supposed to be
incompressible, differs from (20) only by the additional terms</p>

<p class="noind">If &xi;, &eta;, &zeta; vanish at infinite distance the integral of this expression
over all space is zero, when L, M, N are constants, and the same
will be true when these coefficients change from point to point,
provided we add to (21) certain terms containing the differential
coefficients of L, M, N, the physical meaning of these terms being
that, besides the ordinary elastic forces, there is some extraneous
force (called into play by the displacement) acting on all those
elements of volume where L, M, N are not constant. We may
conclude from this that all phenomena can be explained if we admit
the existence of this latter force, which, in the case of two contingent
bodies, reduces to a surface-action on their common boundary.</p>

<p>James MacCullagh<a name="fa28n" id="fa28n" href="#ft28n"><span class="sp">28</span></a> avoided this complication by simply assuming
an expression of the form (20) for the potential energy. He thus
established a theory that is perfectly consistent in itself, and may be
said to have foreshadowed the electromagnetic theory as regards
the form of the equations for transparent bodies. Lord Kelvin
afterwards interpreted MacCullagh&rsquo;s assumption by supposing the
only action which is called forth by a displacement to consist in
certain couples acting on the elements of volume and proportional
to the components ½ {(&part;&zeta;/&part;y) &minus; (&part;&eta;/&part;z)}, &amp;c., of their rotation from
the natural position. He also showed<a name="fa29n" id="fa29n" href="#ft29n"><span class="sp">29</span></a> that this &ldquo;rotational
elasticity&rdquo; can be produced by certain hidden rotations going on
in the medium.</p>
</div>

<p>We cannot dwell here upon other models that have been proposed,
and most of which are of rather limited applicability.
A mechanism of a more general kind ought, of course, to be
adapted to what is known of the molecular constitution of bodies,
and to the highly probable assumption of the perfect permeability
for the aether of all ponderable matter, an assumption
by which it has been possible to escape from one of the objections
raised by Newton (§ 4) (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Aether</a></span>).</p>

<p>The possibility of a truly satisfactory model certainly cannot
be denied. But it would, in all probability, be extremely complicated.
For this reason many physicists rest content, as
regards the free aether, with some such general form of the
electromagnetic theory as has been sketched in § 16.</p>

<p>19. <i>Optical Properties of Ponderable Bodies. Theory of Electrons.</i>&mdash;If
we want to form an adequate representation of optical
phenomena in ponderable bodies, the conceptions of the molecular
and atomistic theories naturally suggest themselves. Already,
in the elastic theory, it had been imagined that certain material
particles are set vibrating by incident waves of light. These
particles had been supposed to be acted on by an elastic force by
which they are drawn back towards their positions of equilibrium,
so that they can perform free vibrations of their own, and by a
resistance that can be represented by terms proportional to the
velocity in the equations of motion, and may be physically
understood if the vibrations are supposed to be converted in
one way or another into a disorderly heat-motion. In this way
it had been found possible to explain the phenomena of dispersion
and (selective) absorption, and the connexion between
them (anomalous dispersion).<a name="fa30n" id="fa30n" href="#ft30n"><span class="sp">30</span></a> These ideas have been also
embodied into the electromagnetic theory. In its more recent
development the extremely small, electrically charged particles,
to which the name of &ldquo;electrons&rdquo; has been given, and which are
supposed to exist in the interior of all bodies, are considered
as forming the connecting links between aether and matter,
and as determining by their arrangement and their motion all
optical phenomena that are not confined to the free aether.<a name="fa31n" id="fa31n" href="#ft31n"><span class="sp">31</span></a></p>

<p>It has thus become clear why the relations that had been established
between optical and electrical properties have been found
to hold only in some simple cases (§ 16). In fact it cannot be
doubted that, for rapidly alternating electric fields, the formulae
expressing the connexion between the motion of electricity and
the electric force take a form that is less simple than the one
previously admitted, and is to be determined in each case by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page623" id="page623"></a>623</span>
elaborate investigation. However, the general boundary conditions
given in § 16 seem to require no alteration. For this
reason it has been possible, for example, to establish a satisfactory
theory of metallic reflection, though the propagation of light in the
interior of a metal is only imperfectly understood.</p>

<p>One of the fundamental propositions of the theory of electrons
is that an electron becomes a centre of radiation whenever its
velocity changes either in direction or in magnitude. Thus
the production of Röntgen rays, regarded as consisting of very
short and irregular electromagnetic impulses, is traced to the
impacts of the electrons of the cathode-rays against the anti-cathode,
and the lines of an emission spectrum indicate the
existence in the radiating body of as many kinds of regular
vibrations, the knowledge of which is the ultimate object of
our investigations about the structure of the spectra. The
shifting of the lines caused, according to Doppler&rsquo;s law, by a
motion of the source of light, may easily be accounted for, as
only general principles are involved in the explanation. To a
certain extent we can also elucidate the changes in the emission
that are observed when the radiating source is exposed to
external magnetic forces (&ldquo;Zeeman-effect&rdquo;; see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Magneto-Optics</a></span>).</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>20. <i>Various Kinds of Light-motion.</i>&mdash;(<i>a</i>) If the disturbance is
represented by</p>

<p class="center"><b>P</b><span class="su">x</span> = 0, <b>P</b><span class="su">y</span> = a cos (nt &minus; kx + &fnof;), <b>P</b><span class="su">z</span> = a&prime; cos (nt &minus; kx + &fnof;&prime;),</p>

<p class="noind">so that the end of the vector <b>P</b> describes an ellipse in a plane perpendicular
to the direction of propagation, the light is said to be
elliptically, or in special cases circularly, polarized. Light of this
kind can be dissolved in many different ways into plane polarized
components.</p>

<p>There are cases in which plane waves must be elliptically or
circularly polarized in order to show the simple propagation of phase
that is expressed by formulae like (5). Instances of this kind occur
in bodies having the property of rotating the plane of polarization,
either on account of their constitution, or under the influence of
a magnetic field. For a given direction of the wave-front there are
in general two kinds of elliptic vibrations, each having a definite
form, orientation, and direction of motion, and a determinate
velocity of propagation. All that has been said about Huygens&rsquo;s
construction applies to these cases.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) In a perfect spectroscope a sharp line would only be observed
if an endless regular succession of simple harmonic vibrations were
admitted into the instrument. In any other case the light will
occupy a certain extent in the spectrum, and in order to determine
its distribution we have to decompose into simple harmonic functions
of the time the components of the disturbance, at a point of the
slit for instance. This may be done by means of Fourier&rsquo;s theorem.</p>

<p>An extreme case is that of the unpolarized light emitted by
incandescent solid bodies, consisting of disturbances whose variations
are highly irregular, and giving a continuous spectrum. But even
with what is commonly called homogeneous light, no perfectly sharp
line will be seen. There is no source of light in which the vibrations
of the particles remain for ever undisturbed, and a particle will
never emit an endless succession of uninterrupted vibrations, but
at best a series of vibrations whose form, phase and intensity are
changed at irregular intervals. The result must be a broadening
of the spectral line.</p>

<p>In cases of this kind one must distinguish between the velocity
of propagation of the phase of regular vibrations and the velocity
with which the said changes travel onward (see below, iii. <i>Velocity
of Light</i>).</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) In a train of plane waves of definite frequency the disturbance
is represented by means of goniometric functions of the time and the
coordinates. Since the fundamental equations are linear, there
are also solutions in which one or more of the coordinates occur in
an exponential function. These solutions are of interest because
the motions corresponding to them are widely different from those
of which we have thus far spoken. If, for example, the formulae
contain the factor</p>

<p class="center">e<span class="sp">&minus;rx</span> cos (nt &minus; sy + l),</p>

<p class="noind">with the positive constant r, the disturbance is no longer periodic
with respect to x, but steadily diminishes as x increases. A state of
things of this kind, in which the vibrations rapidly die away as we
leave the surface, exists in the air adjacent to the face of a glass
prism by which a beam of light is totally reflected. It furnishes us
an explanation of Newton&rsquo;s experiment mentioned in § 2.</p>
</div>
<div class="author">(H. A. L.)</div>

<p class="pt2 center"><span class="sc">III. Velocity of Light</span></p>

<p>The fact that light is propagated with a definite speed was
first brought out by Ole Roemer at Paris, in 1676, through
observations of the eclipses of Jupiter&rsquo;s satellites, made in
different relative positions of the Earth and Jupiter in their
respective orbits. It is possible in this way to determine the time
required for light to pass across the orbit of the earth. The
dimensions of this orbit, or the distance of the sun, being taken
as known, the actual speed of light could be computed. Since
this computation requires a knowledge of the sun&rsquo;s distance,
which has not yet been acquired with certainty, the actual
speed is now determined by experiments made on the earth&rsquo;s
surface. Were it possible by any system of signals to compare
with absolute precision the times at two different stations, the
speed could be determined by finding how long was required
for light to pass from one station to another at the greatest
visible distance. But this is impracticable, because no natural
agent is under our control by which a signal could be communicated
with a greater velocity than that of light. It is
therefore necessary to reflect a ray back to the point of observation
and to determine the time which the light requires to go and
come. Two systems have been devised for this purpose. One
is that of Fizeau, in which the vital appliance is a rapidly revolving
toothed wheel; the other is that of Foucault, in which
the corresponding appliance is a mirror revolving on an axis in, or
parallel to, its own plane.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The principle underlying Fizeau&rsquo;s method is shown in the accompanying
figs. 1 and 2. Fig. 1 shows the course of a ray of light
which, emanating from a luminous point L, strikes the
plane surface of a plate of glass M at an angle of about
<span class="sidenote">Fizeau.</span>
45°. A fraction of the light is reflected from the two surfaces of
the glass to a distant reflector R, the plane of which is at right
angles to the course of the ray. The latter is thus
reflected back on its own course and, passing
through the glass M on its return, reaches a point
E behind the glass. An observer with his eye at E
looking through the glass sees the return ray as a
distant luminous point in the reflector R, after the
light has passed over the course in both directions.</p>

<p>In actual practice it is necessary to interpose the
object glass of a telescope at a point O, at a distance
from M nearly equal to its focal length. The function of this
appliance is to render the diverging rays, shown by the dotted lines,
nearly parallel, in order that more light may reach R and be thrown
back again. But the principle may be conceived without respect to
the telescope, all the rays being ignored except the central one,
which passes over the course we have described.</p>

<table class="flt" style="float: right; width: 140px;" summary="Illustration">

<p>Conceiving the apparatus arranged in such a way that the observer
sees the light reflected from the distant mirror R, a fine toothed
wheel WX is placed immediately in front of the glass M, with its
plane perpendicular to the course of the ray, in such a way that the
ray goes out and returns through an opening between two adjacent
teeth. This wheel is represented in section by WX in fig. 1, and a
part of its circumference, with the teeth as viewed by the observer,
is shown in fig. 2. We conceive that the latter sees the luminous
point between two of the teeth at K. Now, conceive that the
wheel is set in revolution. The ray is then interrupted as every
tooth passes, so that what is sent out is a succession of flashes.
Conceive that the speed of the mirror is such that while the flash is
going to the distant mirror and returning again, each
tooth of the wheel takes the place of an opening
between the teeth. Then each flash sent out will, on
its return, be intercepted by the adjacent tooth, and
will therefore become invisible. If the speed be now
doubled, so that the teeth pass at intervals equal to
the time required for the light to go and come, each
flash sent through an opening will return through the
adjacent opening, and will therefore be seen with full
brightness. If the speed be continuously increased the
result will be successive disappearances and reappearances
of the light, according as a tooth is or is not interposed when
the ray reaches the apparatus on its return. The computation of the
time of passage and return is then very simple. The speed of the
wheel being known, the number of teeth passing in one second can
be computed. The order of the disappearance, or the number of
teeth which have passed while the light is going and coming, being
also determined in each case, the interval of time is computed by a
simple formula.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page624" id="page624"></a>624</span></p>

<p>The most elaborate determination yet made by Fizeau&rsquo;s method
was that of Cornu. The station of observation was at the Paris
Observatory. The distant reflector, a telescope with a
reflector at its focus, was at Montlhéry, distant 22,910
<span class="sidenote">Cornu.</span>
metres from the toothed wheel. Of the wheels most used one had
150 teeth, and was 35 millimetres in diameter; the other had 200
teeth, with a diameter of 45 mm. The highest speed attained was
about 900 revolutions per second. At this speed, 135,000 (or
180,000) teeth would pass per second, and about 20 (or 28) would
pass while the light was going and coming. But the actual speed
attained was generally less than this. The definitive result derived
by Cornu from the entire series of experiments was 300,400 kilometres
per second. Further details of this work need not be set
forth because the method is in several ways deficient in precision.
The eclipses and subsequent reappearances of the light taking place
gradually, it is impossible to fix with entire precision upon the
moment of complete eclipse. The speed of the wheel is continually
varying, and it is impossible to determine with precision what it
was at the instant of an eclipse.</p>

<p>The defect would be lessened were the speed of the toothed
wheel placed under control of the observer who, by action in one
direction or the other, could continually check or accelerate it, so as
to keep the return point of light at the required phase of brightness.
If the phase of complete extinction is chosen for this purpose a
definite result cannot be reached; but by choosing the moment
when the light is of a certain definite brightness, before or after an
eclipse, the observer will know at each instant whether the speed
should be accelerated or retarded, and can act accordingly. The
nearly constant speed through as long a period as is deemed necessary
would then be found by dividing the entire number of revolutions
of the wheel by the time through which the light was kept constant.
But even with these improvements, which were not actually tried
by Cornu, the estimate of the brightness on which the whole result
depends would necessarily be uncertain. The outcome is that,
although Cornu&rsquo;s discussion of his experiments is a model in the
care taken to determine so far as practicable every source of error,
his definitive result is shown by other determinations to have been
too great by about <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1000</span> part of its whole amount.</p>

<p>An important improvement on the Fizeau method was made in
1880 by James Young and George Forbes at Glasgow. This consisted
in using two distant reflectors which were placed
nearly in the same straight line, and at unequal distances.
<span class="sidenote">Young and Forbes.</span>
The ratio of the distances was nearly 12 : 13. The phase
observed was not that of complete extinction of either
light, but that when the two lights appeared equal in intensity.
But it does not appear that the very necessary device of placing the
speed of the toothed wheel under control of the observer was
adopted. The accordance between the different measures was far
from satisfactory, and it will suffice to mention the result which was</p>

<p class="center"><i>Velocity in vacuo</i> = 301,382 km. per second.</p>

<p class="noind">These experimenters also found a difference of 2% between the
speed of red and blue light, a result which can only be attributed to
some unexplained source of error.</p>

<p>The Foucault system is much more precise, because it rests
upon the measurement of an angle, which can be made with great
precision.</p>

<table class="flt" style="float: right; width: 320px;" summary="Illustration">

<p>The vital appliance is a rapidly revolving mirror. Let AB (fig. 3)
be a section of this mirror, which we shall first suppose at rest.
A ray of light LM emanating from a source at L, is reflected
in the direction MQR to a distant mirror R, from
<span class="sidenote">Foucault.</span>
which it is perpendicularly reflected back upon its original course.
This mirror R should be slightly concave, with the centre of curvature
near M, so that the ray shall
always be reflected back to
M on whatever point of R it
may fall. Conceiving the revolving
mirror M as at rest, the
return ray will after three reflections,
at M, R and M again,
be returned along its original
course to the point L from
which it emanated. An important point is that the return ray will
always follow the fixed line ML no matter what the position of the
movable mirror M, provided there is a distant reflector to send the
ray back. Now, suppose that, while the ray is going and coming,
the mirror M, being set in revolution, has turned from the position
in which the ray was reflected to that shown by the dotted line.
If &alpha; be the angle through which the surface has turned, the course
of the return ray, after reflection, will then deviate from ML by the
angle 2&alpha;, and so be thrown to a point E, such that the angle LME =
2&alpha;. If the mirror is in rapid rotation the ray reflected from it will
strike the distant mirror as a series of flashes, each formed by the
light reflected when the mirror was in the position AB. If the speed
of rotation is uniform, the reflected rays from the successive flashes
while the mirror is in the dotted position will thus all follow the
same direction ME after their second reflection from the mirror.
If the motion is sufficiently rapid an eye observing the reflected
ray will see the flashes as an invariable point of light so long as the
speed of revolution remains constant. The time required for the
light to go and come is then equal to that required by the mirror
to turn through half the angle LME, which is therefore to be measured.
In practice it is necessary on this system, as well as on that of
Fizeau, to condense the light by means of a lens, Q, so placed that
L and R shall be at conjugate foci. The position of the lens may be
either between the luminous point L and the mirror M, or between
M and R, the latter being the only one shown in the figure. This
position has the advantage that more light can be concentrated,
but it has the disadvantage that, with a given magnifying power,
the effect of atmospheric undulation, when the concave reflector
is situated at a great distance, is increased in the ratio of the focal
length of the lens to the distance LM from the light to the mirror.
To state the fact in another form, the amplitude of the disturbances
produced by the air in linear measure are proportional to the focal
distance of the lens, while the magnification required increases in
the inverse ratio of the distance LM. Another difficulty associated
with the Foucault system in the form in which its originator used it
is that if the axis of the mirror is at right angles to the course of the
ray, the light from the source L will be flashed directly into the eye
of the observer, on every passage of the revolving mirror through
the position in which its normal bisects the two courses of the ray.
This may be avoided by inclining the axis of the mirror.</p>

<p>In Foucault&rsquo;s determination the measures were not made upon a
luminous point, but upon a reticule, the image of which could not
be seen unless the reflector was quite near the revolving mirror. Indeed
the whole apparatus was contained in his laboratory. The effective
distance was increased by using several reflectors; but the entire
course of the ray measured only 20 metres. The result reached by
Foucault for the velocity of light was 298,000 kilometres per second.</p>

<p>The first marked advance on Foucault&rsquo;s determination was
made by Albert A. Michelson, then a young officer on duty at the
U.S. Naval Academy, Annapolis. The improvement
consisted in using the image of a slit through which the
<span class="sidenote">Michelson.</span>
rays of the sun passed after reflection from a heliostat. In this way
it was found possible to see the image of the slit reflected from the
distant mirror when the latter was nearly 600 metres from the
station of observation. The essentials of the arrangement are those
we have used in fig. 3, L being the slit. It will be seen that the
revolving mirror is here interposed between the lens and its focus.
It was driven by an air turbine, the blast of which was under the
control of the observer, so that it could be kept at any required
speed. The speed was determined by the vibrations of two tuning
forks. One of these was an electric fork, making about 120 vibrations
per second, with which the mirror was kept in unison by a system
of rays reflected from it and the fork. The speed of this fork was
determined by comparison with a freely vibrating fork from time
to time. The speed of the revolving mirror was generally about
275 turns per second, and the deflection of the image of the slit
about 112.5 mm. The mean result of nearly 100 fairly accordant
determinations was:&mdash;</p>

<p>While this work was in progress Simon Newcomb obtained the
official support necessary to make a determination on a yet larger
<span class="sidenote">Newcomb.</span>
scale. The most important modifications made in the
Foucault-Michelson system were the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Placing the reflector at the much greater distance of several
kilometres.</p>

<p>2. In order that the disturbances of the return image due to the
passage of the ray through more than 7 km. of air might be reduced
to a minimum, an ordinary telescope of the &ldquo;broken back&rdquo;
form was used to send the ray to the revolving mirror.</p>

<p>3. The speed of the mirror was, as in Michelson&rsquo;s experiments,
completely under control of the observer, so that by drawing one or
the other of two cords held in the hand the return image could be kept
in any required position. In making each measure the receiving
telescope hereafter described was placed in a fixed position and
during the &ldquo;run&rdquo; the image was kept as nearly as practicable
upon a vertical thread passing through its focus. A &ldquo;run&rdquo; generally
lasted about two minutes, during which time the mirror commonly
made between 25,000 and 30,000 revolutions. The speed per second
was found by dividing the entire number of revolutions by the number
of seconds in the &ldquo;run.&rdquo; The extreme deviations between the times
of transmission of the light, as derived from any two runs, never approached
to the thousandth part of its entire amount. The average
deviation from the mean was indeed less than <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">5000</span> part of the whole.</p>

<p>To avoid the injurious effect of the directly reflected flash, as well
as to render unnecessary a comparison between the directions of
the outgoing and the return ray, a second telescope, turning horizontally
on an axis coincident with that of the revolving mirror,
was used to receive the return ray after reflection. This required
the use of an elongated mirror of which the upper half of the surface
reflected the outgoing ray, and the lower other half received and
reflected the ray on its return. On this system it was not necessary
to incline the mirror in order to avoid the direct reflection of the
return ray. The greatest advantage of this system was that the
revolving mirror could be turned in either direction without break
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page625" id="page625"></a>625</span>
of continuity, so that the angular measures were made between the
directions of the return ray after reflection when the mirror moved
in opposite directions. In this way the speed of the mirror was as
good as doubled, and the possible constant errors inherent in the
reference to a fixed direction for the sending telescope were
eliminated. The essentials of the apparatus are shown in fig. 4.
The revolving mirror was a rectangular prism M of steel, 3 in. high
and 1½ in. on a side
in cross section,
which was driven
by a blast of air
acting on two fan-wheels,
not shown
in the fig., one at
the top, the other
at the bottom of
the mirror. NPO
is the object-end of
the fixed sending
telescope the rays
passing through it being reflected to the mirror by a prism P.
The receiving telescope ABO is straight, and has its objective under
O. It was attached to a frame which could turn around the same
axis as the mirror. The angle through which it moved was
measured by a divided arc immediately below its eye-piece, which
is not shown in the figure. The position AB is that for receiving the
ray during a rotation of the mirror in the anti-clockwise direction;
the position A&prime;B&prime; that for a clockwise rotation.</p>

<p>In these measures the observing station was at Fort Myer, on a
hill above the west bank of the Potomac river. The distant reflector
was first placed in the grounds of the Naval Observatory,
at a distance of 2551 metres. But the definitive measures were
made with the reflector at the base of the Washington monument,
3721 metres distant. The revolving mirror was of nickel-plated
steel, polished on all four vertical sides. Thus four reflections of the
ray were received during each turn of the mirror, which would be
coincident were the form of the mirror invariable. During the
preliminary series of measures it was found that two images of the
return ray were sometimes formed, which would result in two
different conclusions as to the velocity of light, according as one or
the other was observed. The only explanation of this defect which
presented itself was a tortional vibration of the revolving mirror,
coinciding in period with that of revolution, but it was first thought
that the effect was only occasional.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1881 the distant reflector was removed from the
Observatory to the Monument station. Six measures made in
August and September showed a systematic deviation of +67 km.
per second from the result of the Observatory series. This difference
led to measures for eliminating the defect from which it was supposed
to arise. The pivots of the mirror were reground, and a
change made in the arrangement, which would permit of the effect
of the vibration being determined and eliminated. This consisted
in making the relative position of the sending and receiving telescopes
interchangeable. In this way, if the measured deflection
was too great in one position of the telescopes, it would be too
small by an equal amount in the reverse position. As a matter
of fact, when the definitive measures were made, it was found that
with the improved pivots the mean result was the same in the two
positions. But the new result differed systematically from both
the former ones. Thirteen measures were made from the Monument
in the summer of 1882, the results of which will first be stated in
the form of the time required by the ray to go and come. Expressed
in millionths of a second this was:&mdash;</p>

<table class="ws" summary="Contents">
<tr><td class="tcl">Least result of the 13 measures</td> <td class="tcl">24.819</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcl">Greatest result</td> <td class="tcl">24.831</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcl">Double distance between mirrors</td> <td class="tcl">&ensp;7.44242 km.</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="noind">Applying a correction of +12 km. for a slight convexity in the face
of the revolving mirror, this gives as the mean result for the speed
of light in air, 299,778 km. per second. The mean results for the
three series were:&mdash;</p>

<table class="ws" summary="Contents">
<tr><td class="tcl">Observatory, 1880-1881</td> <td class="tcl">V in air = 299,627</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcl">Monument, 1881</td> <td class="tcl">V in air  = 299,694</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcl">Monument, 1882</td> <td class="tcl">V in air = 299,778</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="noind">The last result being the only one from which the effect of distortion
was completely eliminated, has been adopted as definitive. For
reduction to a vacuum it requires a correction of +82 km. Thus
the final result was concluded to be</p>

<p class="center"><i>Velocity of light in vacuo</i> = 299,860 km. per second.</p>

<p class="noind">This result being less by 50 km. than that of Michelson, the latter
made another determination with improved apparatus and arrangements
at the Case School of Applied Science in Cleveland. The
result was</p>

<p class="center"><i>Velocity in vacuo</i> = 299,853 km. per second.</p>

<p class="noind">So far as could be determined from the discordance of the separate
measures, the mean error of Newcomb&rsquo;s result would be less than
±10 km. But making allowance for the various sources of systematic
error the actual probable error was estimated at ±30 km.</p>
</div>

<p>It seems remarkable that since these determinations were
made, a period during which great improvements have become
possible in every part of the apparatus, no complete redetermination
of this fundamental physical constant has been carried out.</p>

<p>The experimental measures thus far cited have been primarily
those of the velocity of light in air, the reduction to a vacuum
being derived from theory alone. The fundamental constant
at the basis of the whole theory is the speed of light in a vacuum,
such as the celestial spaces. The question of the relation between
the velocity in vacuo, and in a transparent medium of any sort,
belongs to the domain of physical optics. Referring to the preceding
section for the principles at play we shall in the present
part of the article confine ourselves to the experimental results.
With the theory of the effect of a transparent medium is associated
that of the possible differences in the speed of light of different
colours.</p>

<p>The question whether the speed of light in vacuo varies with
its wave-length seems to be settled with entire certainty by
observations of variable stars. These are situated at
different distances, some being so far that light must
<span class="sidenote">Velocity and wave-length.</span>
be several centuries in reaching us from them. Were
there any difference in the speed of light of various
colours it would be shown by a change in the colour of the star
as its light waxed and waned. The light of greatest speed
preceding that of lesser speed would, when emanated during
the rising phase, impress its own colour on that which it overtook.
The slower light would predominate during the falling phase.
If there were a difference of 10 minutes in the time at which light
from the two ends of the visible spectrum arrived, it would be
shown by this test. As not the slightest effect of the kind has ever
been seen, it seems certain that the difference, if any, cannot
approximate to <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1.000.000</span> part of the entire speed. The
case is different when light passes through a refracting medium.
It is a theoretical result of the undulatory theory of light that its
velocity in such a medium is inversely proportional to the
refractive index of the medium. This being different for different
colours, we must expect a corresponding difference in the
velocity.</p>

<p>Foucault and Michelson have tested these results of the
undulatory theory by comparing the time required for a ray
of light to pass through a tube filled with a refracting medium,
and through air. Foucault thus found, in a general way, that
there actually was a retardation; but his observations took
account only of the mean retardation of light of all the wave-lengths,
which he found to correspond with the undulatory
theory. Michelson went further by determining the retardation
of light of various wave-lengths in carbon bisulphide. He
made two series of experiments, one with light near the brightest
part of the spectrum; the other with red and blue light. Putting
V for the speed in a vacuum and V<span class="su">1</span> for that in the medium,
his result was</p>

<table class="ws f90" summary="Contents">
<tr><td class="tcl">Yellow light</td> <td class="tcl">V : V<span class="su">1</span> = 1.758</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcl">Refractive index for yellow</td> <td class="tcl">1.64&ensp;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcl">&emsp;&emsp;Difference from theory</td> <td class="tcl">+0.12&ensp;</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="noind">The estimated uncertainty was only 0·02, or <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">6</span> of the difference
between observation and theory.</p>

<p>The comparison of red and blue light was made differentially.
The colours selected were of wave-length about 0.62 for red
and 0.49 for blue. Putting V<span class="su">r</span> and V<span class="su">b</span> for the speeds of red and
blue light respectively in bisulphide of carbon, the mean result
compares with theory as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table class="ws f90" summary="Contents">
<tr><td class="tcl">Observed value of the ratio V<span class="su">r</span>, V<span class="su">b</span></td> <td class="tcl">1.0245</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcl">&emsp;&ensp;Theoretical value (Verdet)</td> <td class="tcl">1.025&ensp;</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="noind">This agreement may be regarded as perfect. It shows that
the divergence of the speed of yellow light in the medium from
theory, as found above, holds through the entire spectrum.</p>

<p>The excess of the retardation above that resulting from
theory is probably due to a difference between &ldquo;wave-speed&rdquo;
and &ldquo;group-speed&rdquo; pointed out by Rayleigh. Let fig. 5 represent
a short series of progressive undulations of constant period
and wave-length. The wave-speed is that required to carry
a wave crest A to the position of the crest B in the wave time.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page626" id="page626"></a>626</span>
But when a flash of light like that measured passes through
a refracting medium, the front waves of the flash are continually
dying away, as shown at the end of the figure, and the place of
each is taken by the wave following. A familiar case of this sort
is seen when a stone is thrown into a pond. The front waves
die out one at a time, to be followed by others, each of which
goes further than its predecessor, while new waves are formed
in the rear. Hence the group, as represented in the figure by the
larger waves in the middle, moves as a whole more slowly than
do the individual waves. When the speed of light is measured
the result is not the wave-speed as above defined, but something
less, because the result depends on the time of the group passing
through the medium. This lower speed is called the group-velocity
of light. In a vacuum there is no dying out of the
waves, so that the group-speed and the wave-speed are identical.
From Michelson&rsquo;s experiments it would follow that the retardation
was about <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">14</span> of the whole speed. This would indicate
that in carbon bisulphide each individual light wave forming
the front of a moving ray dies out in a space of about 15 wave-lengths.</p>

the Greek philosophers, and with the growth of knowledge they
were empirically postulated to explain many diverse phenomena.
Only one &ldquo;aether&rdquo; has survived in modern science&mdash;that associated
with light and electricity, and of which Lord Salisbury, in his presidential
address to the British Association in 1894, said, &ldquo;For more
than two generations the main, if not the only, function of the word
&lsquo;aether&rsquo; has been to furnish a nominative case to the verb &lsquo;to

concerning vision, &amp;c., and the nature of light.</p>

<p><a name="ft3n" id="ft3n" href="#fa3n"><span class="fn">3</span></a> It seems probable that spectacles were in use towards the end
of the 13th century. The Italian dictionary of the <i>Accademici della
Crusca</i> (1612) mentions a sermon of Jordan de Rivalto, published in
1305, which refers to the invention as &ldquo;not twenty years since&rdquo;;
and Muschenbroek states that the tomb of Salvinus Armatus, a
Florentine nobleman who died in 1317, bears an inscription assigning
the invention to him. (See the articles <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Telescope</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Camera

<p><a name="ft4n" id="ft4n" href="#fa4n"><span class="fn">4</span></a> Newton&rsquo;s observation that a second refraction did not change
the colours had been anticipated in 1648 by Marci de Kronland
(1595-1667), professor of medicine at the university of Prague, in
his <i>Thaumantias</i>, who studied the spectrum under the name of
<i>Iris trigonia</i>. There is no evidence that Newton knew of this,
although he mentions de Dominic&rsquo;s experiment with the glass globe
containing water.</p>

<p><a name="ft5n" id="ft5n" href="#fa5n"><span class="fn">5</span></a> The geometrical determination of the form of the surface which
will reflect, or of the surface dividing two media which will refract,
rays from one point to another, is very easily effected by using the
&ldquo;characteristic function&rdquo; of Hamilton, which for the problems
under consideration may be stated in the form that &ldquo;the optical
paths of all rays must be the same.&rdquo; In the case of reflection, if
A and B be the diverging and converging points, and P a point on
the reflecting surface, then the locus of P is such that AP + PB is
constant. Therefore the surface is an ellipsoid of revolution having
A and B as foci. If the rays be parallel, <i>i.e.</i> if A be at infinity, the
surface is a paraboloid of revolution having B as focus and the axis
parallel to the direction of the rays. In refraction if A be in the
medium of index µ, and B in the medium of index µ&prime;, the characteristic
function shows that µAP + µ&prime;PB, where P is a point on
the surface, must be constant. Plane sections through A and B
of such surfaces were originally investigated by Descartes, and are
named Cartesian ovals. If the rays be parallel, <i>i.e.</i> A be at infinity,
the surface becomes an ellipsoid of revolution having B for one
focus, µ&prime;/µ for eccentricity, and the axis parallel to the direction of
the rays.</p>

showed that the velocity was less in water than in air, thereby
confirming the undulatory and invalidating the emission theory.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LIGHTFOOT, JOHN<a name="ar132" id="ar132"></a></span> (1602-1675), English divine and rabbinical
scholar, was the son of Thomas Lightfoot, vicar of
Uttoxeter, Staffordshire, and was born at Stoke-upon-Trent
on the 29th of March 1602. His education was received at
Morton Green near Congleton, Cheshire, and at Christ&rsquo;s College,
Cambridge, where he was reckoned the best orator among
the undergraduates. After taking his degree he became assistant
master at Repton in Derbyshire; after taking orders he was
appointed curate of Norton-under-Hales in Shropshire. There
he attracted the notice of Sir Rowland Cotton, an amateur
Hebraist of some distinction, who made him his domestic
chaplain at Bellaport. Shortly after the removal of Sir Rowland
to London, Lightfoot, abandoning an intention to go abroad,
accepted a charge at Stone in Staffordshire, where he continued
for about two years. From Stone he removed to Hornsey, near
London, for the sake of reading in the library of Sion College.
His first published work, entitled <i>Erubhin, or Miscellanies,
Christian and Judaical, penned for recreation at vacant hours</i>,
and dedicated to Sir R. Cotton, appeared at London in 1629.
In September 1630 he was presented by Sir R. Cotton to the
rectory of Ashley in Staffordshire, where he remained until
June, 1642, when he went to London, probably to superintend
the publication of his next work, <i>A Few and New Observations
upon the Book of Genesis: the most of them certain; the rest,
probable; all, harmless, strange and rarely heard of before</i>,
which appeared at London in that year. Soon after his arrival
in London he became minister of St Bartholomew&rsquo;s church,
near the Exchange; and in 1643 he was appointed to preach
the sermon before the House of Commons on occasion of the
public fast of the 29th of March. It was published under the
title of <i>Elias Redivivus</i>, the text being Luke i. 17; in it a parallel
is drawn between the Baptist&rsquo;s ministry and the work of reformation
which in the preacher&rsquo;s judgment was incumbent on the
parliament of his own day.</p>

<p>Lightfoot was also one of the original members of the Westminster
Assembly; his &ldquo;Journal of the Proceedings of the
Assembly of Divines from January 1, 1643 to December 31,
1644,&rdquo; now printed in the thirteenth volume of the 8vo edition
of his <i>Works</i>, is a valuable historical source for the brief period
to which it relates. He was assiduous in his attendance, and,
though frequently standing almost or quite alone, especially
in the Erastian controversy, he exercised a material influence
on the result of the discussions of the Assembly. In 1643 Lightfoot
published <i>A Handful of Gleanings out of the Book of Exodus</i>,
and in the same year he was made master of Catharine Hall
by the parliamentary visitors of Cambridge, and also, on the
recommendation of the Assembly, was promoted to the rectory
of Much Munden in Hertfordshire; both appointments he retained
until his death. In 1644 was published in London the
first instalment of the laborious but never completed work
of which the full title runs <i>The Harmony of the Four Evangelists
among themselves, and with the Old Testament, with an explanation
of the chiefest difficulties both in Language and Sense: Part I.
From the beginning of the Gospels to the Baptism of our Saviour.</i>
The second part <i>From the Baptism of our Saviour to the first
Passover after</i> followed in 1647, and the third <i>From the first
Passover after our Saviour&rsquo;s Baptism to the second</i> in 1650. On
the 26th of August 1645 he again preached before the House
of Commons on the day of their monthly fast. His text was
Rev. xx. 1, 2. After controverting the doctrine of the Millenaries,
he urged various practical suggestions for the repression
with a strong hand of current blasphemies, for a thorough
revision of the authorized version of the Scriptures, for the
encouragement of a learned ministry, and for a speedy settlement
of the church. In the same year appeared <i>A Commentary
upon the Acts of the Apostles, chronical and critical; the Difficulties
of the text explained, and the times of the Story cast into
annals. From the beginning of the Book to the end of the Twelfth
Chapter. With a brief survey of the contemporary Story of the
Jews and Romans</i> (down to the third year of Claudius). In
1647 he published <i>The Harmony, Chronicle, and Order of the
Old Testament</i>, which was followed in 1655 by <i>The Harmony,
Chronicle, and Order of the New Testament</i>, inscribed to Cromwell.
In 1654 Lightfoot had been chosen vice-chancellor of the
university of Cambridge, but continued to reside by preference
at Munden, in the rectory of which, as well as in the mastership
of Catharine Hall, he was confirmed at the Restoration. The
remainder of his life was devoted to helping Brian Walton with
the Polyglot Bible (1657) and to his own best-known work,
the <i>Horae Hebraicae et Talmudicae</i>, in which the volume relating
to Matthew appeared in 1658, that relating to Mark in 1663,
and those relating to 1 Corinthians, John and Luke, in 1664,
1671 and 1674 respectively. While travelling from Cambridge
to Ely (where he had been collated in 1668 by Sir Orlando
Bridgman to a prebendal stall), he caught a severe cold, and
died at Ely on the 6th of December 1675. The <i>Horae Hebraicae
et Talmudicae impensae in Acta Apostolorum et in Ep. S. Pauli
ad Romanos</i> were published posthumously.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The <i>Works</i> of Lightfoot were first edited, in 2 vols. fol., by G.
Bright and Strype in 1684; the <i>Opera Omnia, cura Joh. Texelii</i>,
appeared at Rotterdam in 1686 (2 vols. fol.), and again, edited by
J. Leusden, at Franeker in 1699 (3 vols. fol.). A volume of <i>Remains</i>
was published at London in 1700. The <i>Hor. Hebr. et Talm</i>. were
also edited in Latin by Carpzov (Leipzig, 1675-1679), and again, in
English, by Gandell (Oxford, 1859). The most complete edition is
that of the <i>Whole Works</i>, in 13 vols. 8vo, edited, with a life, by
R. Pitman (London, 1822-1825). It includes, besides the works
already noticed, numerous sermons, letters and miscellaneous
writings; and also <i>The Temple, especially as it stood in the Days of
our Saviour</i> (London, 1650).</p>
